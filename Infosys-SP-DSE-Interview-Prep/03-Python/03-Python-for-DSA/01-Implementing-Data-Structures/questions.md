1. **Which built-in containers map to classic data structures?**
   - list = dynamic array; tuple = persistent array; dict/set = hash table; deque = queue/deque; heapq = binary heap; str = char sequence — all ready in stdlib.

2. **How do you implement a stack in Python?**
   - A list with append()/pop() gives O(1) LIFO; or collections.deque for thread-safety. The stack interview primitive.

3. **How do you implement a queue in Python?**
   - collections.deque with append()/popleft() (O(1) both ends); queue.Queue is a thread-safe blocking wrapper. A single list head is O(n) — avoid.

4. **How do you implement a min-heap?**
   - import heapq; heapq.heappush(h, x); heapq.heappop(h) — Python's heapq IS a min-heap binary tree in a list; use -values for max-heap behaviour.

5. **How do you implement a binary-search tree (BST)?**
   - A Node class with left/right and insert/search/delete traversals; Python's recursion rebuilds nodes (3.12) or iterative pointer walking avoids recursion limits.

6. **How do you implement a linked list in Python?**
   - class Node: __init__(self, val, next=None); maintain head reference with iterative loops and dummy-node sentinel for edge cases.

7. **How do you implement a hash table from scratch?**
   - Array of buckets + hash() of keys + separate chaining or open addressing; Python's dict does this natively but interviews test the theory.

8. **How do you implement a graph adjacency list?**
   - dict: node -> list/set of neighbours (or dict of weights); 30 lines take you through BFS/DFS/Dijkstra — the foundational interview representation.

9. **What is a Trie and how to implement it?**
   - A tree of characters; children dict per node with an end-of-word flag — prefix queries in O(len) using sum/any/all and set of `words` termination.

10. **How do you implement LRU cache in Python?**
   - collections.OrderedDict move_to_end/popitem(last=False), or linked list + dict manually — the classic system-design-on-whiteboard pair.

11. **How do you implement a disjoint-set (Union-Find)?**
   - parent array + rank/size, find with path compression, union by size — near O(alpha(n)) inverse Ackermann for connectivity problems.

12. **How do you implement a segment tree?**
   - A 4n array tree of range aggregates; build, point update, range query — O(log n); iterative version avoids recursion.

13. **Define 01 implementing data structures in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 01 implementing data structures is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

14. **Why is 01 implementing data structures important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

15. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 implementing data structures?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

16. **Compare 01 implementing data structures with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

17. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 implementing data structures knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

18. **What common misconceptions exist about 01 implementing data structures?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

19. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 implementing data structures?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

20. **Describe 01 implementing data structures as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

21. **How does 01 implementing data structures interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

22. **What would you change about how 01 implementing data structures is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

23. **Define 01 implementing data structures in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - One line: 01 implementing data structures is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data.

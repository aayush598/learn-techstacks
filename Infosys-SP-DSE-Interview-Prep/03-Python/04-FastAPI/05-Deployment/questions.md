1. **How do you containerise a FastAPI app?**
   - Dockerfile: python:3.11-slim, pip install from requirements, uvicorn command — multistage builds shrink image size for prod.

2. **What is the production run command for FastAPI?**
   - gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app — multiple processes balancing async workers; or uvicorn directly for small apps.

3. **What is the .dockerignore / .env handling?**
   - Exclude __pycache__, .venv, .env from the image; forward DATABASE_URL/SECRET_KEY via environment/compose — never bake secrets into images.

4. **What does the HEALTHCHECK endpoint do?**
   - GET /health returning 200 when the app is up — used by load balancers and container orchestrators to decide instance health.

5. **How do you approach zero-downtime deploys?**
   - Rolling updates (multiple instances restaged), readiness probes, and tagging immutable images — standard release engineering for APIs.

6. **What is uvicorn vs gunicorn vs daphne?**
   - uvicorn: ASGI server (async). gunicorn: WSGI process manager wrapping uvicorn workers for CPU scaling. daphne: Django-specific ASGI.

7. **How do you manage environment configuration?**
   - pydantic-settings BaseSettings reading env vars / .env files with typed defaults — config moving safely between dev/staging/prod.

8. **What is a reverse proxy + TLS termination?**
   - nginx/traefik or a cloud LB terminates HTTPS and proxies to uvicorn on localhost — offloading certs and adding buffering.

9. **How do you set up CI/CD for the API?**
   - GitHub Actions: run pytest + lint, build/push image, then deploy to the cluster/server on merge — the pipeline you listed on your resume.

10. **What metrics/logging do you ship?**
   - Structured JSON logs via logging, request latency/error-rate metrics, and /metrics (Prometheus format) — observability prerequisites.

11. **How do you debug a crashed production instance?**
   - Read structured logs, check health/readiness events, inspect resource metrics, reproduce locally with the same image/version — the SRE rundown.

12. **Define 05 deployment in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 05 deployment is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 05 deployment important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 05 deployment?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 05 deployment with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 05 deployment knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 05 deployment?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 05 deployment?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 05 deployment as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 05 deployment interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 05 deployment is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 05 deployment in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - One line: 05 deployment is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

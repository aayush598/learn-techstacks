1. **What is the difference between if/elif/else and a switch statement?**
   - Python has no switch/case (until match case); elif chains evaluate sequentially. match/case (3.10+) provides structural pattern matching.

2. **How do for and while loops work?**
   - for iterates over any iterable (list, range, dict, generator); while repeats while a condition is truthy; else on a loop runs if no break occurred.

3. **What does break, continue, and pass do?**
   - break exits the innermost loop, continue skips to the next iteration, pass is a no-op placeholder (also used in empty classes/functions).

4. **What is a list comprehension?**
   - A concise constructor: [expr for x in iterable if cond]; equivalent to nested for + append. Prefer comprehensions for readability and speed.

5. **What is the ternary conditional expression?**
   - value_if_true if condition else value_if_false — a compact branch; avoid nesting multiple ternaries for readability.

6. **What is zip() used for in loops?**
   - Pairs iterables element-wise: for a,b in zip(xs,ys); stops at the shortest; zip_longest (itertools) pads instead.

7. **What is enumerate()?**
   - Yields (index, element) pairs in a loop — better than manual range(len(x)) indexing for most cases.

8. **What is short-circuit evaluation?**
   - and/or evaluate left to right and stop early: `None or value` returns value, `x and f(x)` never calls f when x falsy — guards avoid errors.

9. **What does a for/else or while/else clause mean?**
   - The else block runs only when the loop completes without break — a concise 'didn't find it' flag for search loops.

10. **What is a walrus operator (:=)?**
   - Assignment expression binding a value inline: while (line := f.readline()): — Python 3.8+, reduces duplicate calls in conditions.

11. **Define 02 control flow in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 02 control flow is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 02 control flow important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 02 control flow?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 02 control flow with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 02 control flow knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 02 control flow?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 02 control flow?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 02 control flow as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 02 control flow interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 02 control flow is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 02 control flow in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

1. **What is a string in Python?**
   - An immutable sequence of Unicode characters; concatenation/sub/replace produce new objects; also sliceable, iterable, and hashable.

2. **What is the difference between str methods find and index?**
   - both locate a substring; index raises ValueError, find returns -1 on missing — choose find for probing, index when absence is an error.

3. **What are the main string methods?**
   - split/join, strip/lstrip/rstrip, replace, lower/upper, startswith/endswith, count, find/index, format/f-strings — the interview roster.

4. **How do you check if a string is a palindrome?**
   - s == s[::-1] after cleaning (lowercase, strip non-alphanumerics). The one-liner every interviewer accepts.

5. **What is f-string formatting?**
   - f'{name}, score={score:.2f}' — inline interpolation with format specifiers; Python 3.6+ and the recommended style (faster than % and .format()).

6. **What is the difference between split() and split(' ')?**
   - split() splits on ANY whitespace runs and drops empties; split(' ') splits on single spaces preserving empties — a notorious edge case.

7. **What is join() and its efficiency?**
   - '-'.join(items) builds one string in one pass — far faster than '+' in a loop (which creates many intermediates).

8. **What are raw strings and regular expressions interplay?**
   - r'\d+' keeps backslashes literal so regexes write naturally; without r, '\d' becomes the escape rule of Python strings.

9. **What is a substring check and longest-common-prefix approach?**
   - sub in s returns boolean in O(n). For longest common prefix: compare char-by-char across strings, stop at first mismatch — vertical scan.

10. **What is str.isdigit vs str.isnumeric?**
   - isdigit covers 0-9 and digit subclasses; isnumeric adds other numeral scripts (roman digits); both ignore minus signs/dots — use carefully on user input.

11. **How do you handle Unicode/special characters?**
   - Python strings are Unicode; encode to bytes via .encode('utf-8'), handle normalisation (NFC) for equivalence; len() counts code points, not bytes.

12. **Define 06 string operations in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 06 string operations is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 06 string operations important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 06 string operations?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 06 string operations with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 06 string operations knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 06 string operations?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 06 string operations?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 06 string operations as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 06 string operations interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 06 string operations is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 06 string operations in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

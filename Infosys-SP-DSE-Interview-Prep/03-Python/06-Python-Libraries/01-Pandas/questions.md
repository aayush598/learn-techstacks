# Python Libraries — Pandas Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is a DataFrame?
**A:** A labelled 2D table with Series columns (typed, indexable) — pandas' core structure for tabular data manipulation.

## Q2: What is a Series?
**A:** A one-dimensional labelled array (index + values) — the column primitive underlying DataFrames; ops vectorise like NumPy.

## Q3: What is the difference between loc and iloc?
**A:** loc selects by label (df.loc['row','col']), iloc by integer position — mixing them is a classic bug; both support slices.

## Q4: How do you filter rows?
**A:** Boolean masks: df[df['age'] > 30]; combine with & | ~ (use parentheses); .query() writes it as a string expression.

## Q5: How do you group and aggregate?
**A:** df.groupby('category')['amount'].sum() / .agg(['sum','mean','count']) — the pandas analogue of SQL GROUP BY.

## Q6: How do you handle missing values?
**A:** df.isna().sum() to inspect; df.dropna() and df.fillna(value / method='ffill') — choosing per analysis, never by default.

## Q7: How do you merge two DataFrames?
**A:** pd.merge(a, b, on='key', how='inner'/'left') maps SQL JOINs; pd.concat stacks rows/columns when concatenating.

## Q8: What is the difference between apply, map, and applymap?
**A:** Series.map maps values; df.apply applies row/column-wise functions; applymap applies elementwise on a DataFrame — pick per axis.

## Q9: How do you read data from various formats?
**A:** pd.read_csv, read_json, read_excel, read_sql(query, engine) — parsing datasets directly into DataFrames for analysis.

## Q10: What is the vectorisation benefit over Python loops?
**A:** NaN-safe column ops execute in C; a group-level calculation that loops 100k rows in Python is a 100x slowdown compared to pandas idioms.

## Q11: How do you reshape data?
**A:** df.pivot_table(values=..., index=..., columns=...) and df.melt(id_vars=...) flip wide/long — the tidy-data operations.

## Q12: How do you compute salary/aggregate stats for a report?
**A:** df.groupby('dept')['salary'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False) — chaining groupby-agg-sort, the analysis idiom interviewers want to hear.

## Q13: Define 01 pandas in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 01 pandas is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q14: Why is 01 pandas important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q15: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 pandas?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q16: Compare 01 pandas with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q17: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 pandas knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q18: What common misconceptions exist about 01 pandas?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q19: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 pandas?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q20: Describe 01 pandas as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q21: How does 01 pandas interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q22: What would you change about how 01 pandas is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

## Q23: Define 01 pandas in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.

1. **What is the requests library?**
   - The de-facto HTTP client for Python — params, headers, JSON bodies, sessions, and timeouts wrapped in a clean API.

2. **How do you make a GET request with parameters?**
   - requests.get(url, params={'q': 'x'}) — params auto-encodes into the query string; headers= sets auth/accept.

3. **How do you handle a POST with JSON?**
   - requests.post(url, json={'key': 'value'}) — json= serialises, sets Content-Type: application/json; data= sends form-encoded.

4. **What is the difference between response.text, .json(), and .content?**
   - .text decodes str; .json() parses JSON (raises on invalid); .content is raw bytes — choose based on the payload format.

5. **What is check_for_status?**
   - resp.raise_for_status() raises HTTPError for 4xx/5xx — forcing explicit error handling instead of silent partial data.

6. **What is a requests.Session and why reuse it?**
   - Session persists cookies and TCP connections across calls — performance and state (login tokens) for multi-request flows.

7. **How do you set timeouts and what are their layers?**
   - timeout=(connect_timeout, read_timeout) — without it, requests can hang forever; the interview answer for 'why did my script stall'.

8. **How do you send a file or multipart upload?**
   - requests.post(url, files={'file': ('x.csv', open('x.csv','rb'))}) — multipart/form-data for typical upload APIs.

9. **What is a Basic-auth and Bearer-token header?**
   - requests.get(url, auth=('user','pass')) builds Basic; headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'} for JWT — the API protocol companions.

10. **How do you retry requests robustly?**
   - urllib3 Retry with backoff_factor and status_forcelist — the resilient-client pattern (used under LangChain/Agno HTTP tools too).

11. **How do you handle JSON errors in a response?**
   - Checks status then resp.json(); wrap in try/except for spec drift — graceful degradation whenever a third-party API changes shape.

12. **Define 03 requests and http in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 03 requests and http is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 03 requests and http important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 03 requests and http?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 03 requests and http with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 03 requests and http knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 03 requests and http?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 03 requests and http?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 03 requests and http as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 03 requests and http interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 03 requests and http is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 03 requests and http in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - One line: 03 requests and http is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data.

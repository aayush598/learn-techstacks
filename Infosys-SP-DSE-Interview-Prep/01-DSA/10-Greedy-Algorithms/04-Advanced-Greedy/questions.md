# Greedy Algorithms — Advanced Greedy Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What makes a greedy problem 'advanced'?
**A:** Hidden monotonic structure, exchange proofs, combining greedy with a heap (e.g., task scheduler), or matching with sorting and interval constraints.

## Q2: How do you solve the 'task scheduler' problem (letters, cooldown n)?
**A:** Max-frequency first; answer = max((maxFreq-1)*(n+1)+countMax, len(tasks)) — a clever closed form. Prove by arranging the heavy letter in slots.

## Q3: How do you solve 'candy distribution' (ratings)?
**A:** Two passes: left-to-right (candy[i] = +1 if rating>left) then right-to-left adjusting; sum. O(n).

## Q4: How do you solve the 'jump game II' minimum jumps?
**A:** Greedy: farthest reachable while within a step's window; count one jump per window. O(n). The greedy avoids DP's O(n^2).

## Q5: How do you solve 'IPO' / 'best profit with capital'?
**A:** Two heaps: affordable projects by capital (max-heap of profit) and remaining sorted by capital — the greedy selection at each stage. O(n log n).

## Q6: How do you solve 'maximum width ramp' style?
**A:** Monotonic stack of strictly decreasing values then scan right; O(n).

## Q7: How do you solve 'minimum deletion to make string good (no 3 same adjacent)'?
**A:** Greedy count current run; reset at 3. O(n).

## Q8: How do you solve 'maximum cows with a scaling k' (watch-out problems)?
**A:** Binary search answer k, greedy check feasibility; the answer is monotone in k so the search is over the count. This 'binary search + greedy check' fusion is common.

## Q9: How do you prove jump-game-style greediness?
**A:** Exchange/invariant: at every index maintain the union-reach invariant and show greedy never worsens it — agree max reach is monotone, so the greedy jump is safe.

## Q10: How does the 'gas station' greedy actually prove correctness?
**A:** If total>=cost, the chain sums stay non-negative after going from the global-min index — a single index always works; prove by prefix-sum minima.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 04 advanced greedy technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 04 advanced greedy problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 04 advanced greedy problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 04 advanced greedy implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 04 advanced greedy code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 04 advanced greedy.
**A:** Analogy: 04 advanced greedy is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 04 advanced greedy?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 04 advanced greedy?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 04 advanced greedy.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 04 advanced greedy asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

## Q21: What is the intuition behind the 04 advanced greedy technique used in coding interviews? Extend your answer with a second example.

**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 04 advanced greedy. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 04 advanced greedy asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

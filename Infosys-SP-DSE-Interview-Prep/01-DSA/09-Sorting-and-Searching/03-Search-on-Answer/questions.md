1. **What is 'search on answer' and when is it used?**
   - Binary-search an integer or float ANSWER because feasibility is monotone; the check runs a separate greedy/count/DP. Time = O(log(hi-lo) · check).

2. **How do you use it for 'minimum time to reach target speed'?**
   - Binary search speed; feasible(s) = total time of segments ≤ limit. margin = speed is monotonic. O(log range · n).

3. **How do you find the 'kth smallest sum of two arrays' via search-on-answer?**
   - Binary search the value x, count pairs with sum ≤ x via two pointers; if count ≥ k the answer is ≤ x. O(n log MAX).

4. **How do you check range-content equality for a binary-searched median?**
   - Counting smaller-than-mid elements across arrays is monotonic; binary search the median value and count — the classic '4th smallest' formulation.

5. **When does search-on-answer fail?**
   - When feasibility is not monotone (count crosses 0 then comes back) or when the predicate has plateaus with non-monotonicity; always verify monotonicity first.

6. **How do you parallelise the monotone check?**
   - Precompute per-range contributions and binary search with cumulative counting — the check stays O(n) but independent checks are vectorised/hidden-test friendly.

7. **What is the precision requirement convention in float search-on-answer?**
   - Run while high-low > 1e-9 or a fixed iterations count (~60 iterations for double range) to avoid infinite loops; guard against last-digit flips.

8. **Give a real Infosys-style search-on-answer problem.**
   - 'Minimum max time to watch all N movies with M hours per day' or 'dividing an array into k subarrays to minimise max sum' — both use feasible(limit) + binary search.

9. **How does 'split array largest sum' fit?**
   - Binary search largest-sum; feasible = can split into k parts each ≤ sum with greedy; answer = smallest feasible bound. O(n log sum).

10. **How do you combine search-on-answer with graph algorithms?**
   - Binary search the answer (edge weight threshold) and check reachability with BFS/DFS under the threshold — common in 'cheapest path within budget'.

11. **What is the intuition behind the 03 search on answer technique used in coding interviews?**
   - The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

12. **Write the brute-force approach for a typical 03 search on answer problem and analyse it.**
   - Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

13. **State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 03 search on answer problems.**
   - The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

14. **What common edge cases must be handled in 03 search on answer implementations?**
   - Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

15. **How would you dry-run your 03 search on answer code on a small example in an interview?**
   - Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

16. **Give a real-world analogy for 03 search on answer.**
   - Analogy: 03 search on answer is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

17. **How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 03 search on answer?**
   - Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

18. **What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 03 search on answer?**
   - Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

19. **Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 03 search on answer.**
   - First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

20. **How is 03 search on answer asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?**
   - In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

21. **What is the intuition behind the 03 search on answer technique used in coding interviews? Extend your answer with a second example.**

   - Analogy: 03 search on answer is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

97. **How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 03 search on answer? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

98. **What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 03 search on answer? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

99. **Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 03 search on answer. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

100. **How is 03 search on answer asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

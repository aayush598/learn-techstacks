# Segment Trees And Fenwick — Segment Tree Basics Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is a segment tree?
**A:** A tree over an array answering range queries (sum, min, max, gcd) and supporting point/range updates in O(log n). Leaves store array elements; internal nodes store aggregates of children.

## Q2: State the time complexity of segment tree operations.
**A:** Build O(n), query O(log n), point-update O(log n), range-update with lazy O(log n). Space O(4n) with the standard 1-indexed flat array.

## Q3: How does query-range work?
**A:** If the node's range is fully inside [l,r] return its aggregate; if disjoint return identity; else split and combine children. O(log n) with canonical decomposition.

## Q4: How do point updates propagate?
**A:** Recursively update the leaf, then recompute the parent as combine(left,right) on unwind. O(log n). Only ancestors need fixing.

## Q5: How do you choose the size of the segment tree array?
**A:** 4*n is the safe estimate for the recursive implementation; iterative (array of 2*size with padding to power of two) uses exactly 2*size — state both.

## Q6: When would you use a segment tree over a Fenwick tree?
**A:** Segment trees handle MIN/MAX and range-update (lazy) natively; Fenwick trees are faster and simpler for point-update + prefix-query (sum-like).

## Q7: What is a lazy propagation and why is it needed?
**A:** Deferring a range update to children until it is queried; without it, a range update is O(n). Lazy tag on each node records pending updates — query/update both push tags. O(log n).

## Q8: How do you implement 'range sum with range add' (lazy)?
**A:** Each node stores sum and a lazy-add; push before descending modifies children sums; applying a lazy to a full-covered node updates sum += tag*len covering the range. O(log n).

## Q9: How do you build the tree recursively?
**A:** build(node, l, r): if l==r store arr[l]; else mid, build children, tree[node]=combine(tree[left],tree[right]). O(n) nodes visited.

## Q10: How do you combine two aggregate types (min, count)?
**A:** For 'min + count' store a pair; combine chooses the smaller (or sums counts when equal). Structure that: -  relative to the OPERATOR the combine must implement.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 01 segment tree basics technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 01 segment tree basics problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 01 segment tree basics problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 01 segment tree basics implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 01 segment tree basics code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 01 segment tree basics.
**A:** Analogy: 01 segment tree basics is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 01 segment tree basics?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 01 segment tree basics?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 01 segment tree basics.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 01 segment tree basics asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

## Q97: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 01 segment tree basics? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q98: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 01 segment tree basics? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 01 segment tree basics. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 01 segment tree basics asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

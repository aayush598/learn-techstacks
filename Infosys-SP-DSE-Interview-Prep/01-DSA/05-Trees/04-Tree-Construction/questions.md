# Trees — Tree Construction Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: How do you construct a binary tree from preorder and inorder arrays?
**A:** Preorder's first element is root; locate it in inorder (hash map O(1)), left section = left subtree, right section = right subtree; recurse with advancing preorder index. O(n).

## Q2: How do you construct a tree from postorder and inorder?
**A:** Postorder's LAST element is root; locate in inorder, recurse right-subtree first (because postorder lists right before root-end), then left. O(n).

## Q3: Can you reconstruct uniquely from preorder and postorder alone?
**A:** No — a node with one child makes pre+post ambiguous. Pre+inorder or in+postorder give unique trees; pre+post need extra info (like child marks).

## Q4: How do you serialise and deserialise a binary tree?
**A:** Serialize: preorder with 'None' markers into a list/string. Deserialize: consume markers reconstructing recursively. O(n). This was a classic hard SP question.

## Q5: How do you build a complete binary tree from a level-order list?
**A:** Index-based: node at i has children at 2i+1 and 2i+2 (0-indexed) — build nodes array, attach children when index exists. O(n).

## Q6: How do you build a BST from a sorted linked list?
**A:** Find mid via slow/fast, make it root, recurse on the two halves (bottom-up possible using size and global head). O(n log n) naive, O(n) bottom-up.

## Q7: How do you build a BST from a sorted array (balanced)?
**A:** Middle element = root, recurse on left/right halves. O(n) total; guaranteed balanced since halves are equal size.

## Q8: How do you build a Cartesian tree from an array?
**A:** Root is the minimum element; left/right children are Descartes trees of the subarrays. Stack construction O(n); links arrays + nearest smaller bounds.

## Q9: What is a segment-tree-like fixed construction over arrays?
**A:** Recursive build over range [l,r] from arr: node stores aggregate; parent = combine(children). O(n) build where n leaves (use padding to power of 2 if using arrays).

## Q10: How do you determine uniqueness constraints for reconstruction questions?
**A:** Ask whether 'distinct values' is guaranteed — with duplicates reconstruction becomes non-unique; the same inorder position may appear in both subtrees.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 04 tree construction technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 04 tree construction problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 04 tree construction problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 04 tree construction implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 04 tree construction code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 04 tree construction.
**A:** Analogy: 04 tree construction is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 04 tree construction?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 04 tree construction?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 04 tree construction.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 04 tree construction asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

## Q98: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 04 tree construction? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 04 tree construction. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 04 tree construction asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

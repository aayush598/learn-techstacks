# Two Pointers — Pair Sum Problems Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: How do you find if two numbers sum to target in a sorted array?
**A:** Two pointers l/r; if arr[l]+arr[r]==target return, if< then l++, else r--; O(n). If unsorted, sort first or use hash set for O(n) with O(n) space.

## Q2: What is the two-sum 'count pairs' variant?
**A:** Use a multi-set hash to count complement occurrences — O(n). With duplicates the count bookkeeping matters; state both sorted-pointer and hash approaches.

## Q3: How do you find exactly k pairs with absolute difference d?
**A:** Sort then two pointers counting pairs by walking both pointers; or a frequency counter. O(n log n) dominant.

## Q4: How does the three-sum problem use two pointers?
**A:** Fix the first element i, then two-pointer over the rest for -nums[i]; skip duplicates. O(n^2) total.

## Q5: How do you find the closest pair sum to a given value?
**A:** Sorted two-pointer; track the minimal |arr[l]+arr[r]-target| while moving towards the target from both ends. O(n).

## Q6: How do you check pairs with sum greater/less than k?
**A:** Sorted: if l+r>k count valid ending combos as (r-l) with right pointer moves; else left pointer moves; O(n).

## Q7: How do you handle duplicates in three-sum?
**A:** Skip the same first value and same second value after the loop (while-loops advancing past equals) — dedupe triples explicitly.

## Q8: What is a 'pair with product k' search?
**A:** Use a hash set of visited numbers checking k/x when x!=0, or two-pointer after sort — the product variant flips comparisons.

## Q9: How do you find pairs whose squares or abs sum to k?
**A:** Same pointer logic but with squared/absolute values: compare (l^2+r^2) to k and move accordingly — still monotone.

## Q10: How do you answer 'count pairs with xor k'?
**A:** Hash map of seen numbers: for each x count seen[x^k]; xor hashes make it O(n) — a two-pointer immaterial case; mention the distinction.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 03 pair sum problems technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 03 pair sum problems problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 03 pair sum problems problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 03 pair sum problems implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 03 pair sum problems code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 03 pair sum problems.
**A:** Analogy: 03 pair sum problems is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 03 pair sum problems?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 03 pair sum problems?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 03 pair sum problems.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 03 pair sum problems asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q98: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 03 pair sum problems? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 03 pair sum problems. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 03 pair sum problems asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

# Two Pointers — Container Problems Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: State 'Container With Most Water' and its two-pointer solution.
**A:** Maximize area between two vertical lines: two pointers at both ends, track max area, move the shorter line inward. O(n).

## Q2: How does the cold-storage problem (water trapped) map to pointers?
**A:** Cold storage = same trapped-water: two-pointer with running left/right maxima computes trapped volume O(n), exactly the 'trapping rain water' formula.

## Q3: What is the formula for area in container problems?
**A:** area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r-l). Maximizing it is solved by pointer movement that never skips the optimum — argue via monotonicity.

## Q4: What variants exist (wrapped containers)?
**A:** Circular traps, obstacles in between, or plates (density) add conditions — the pointer proof extends when movement preserves monotonic feasibility.

## Q5: How do you compute the maximum water with k platforms?
**A:** Stack/segment-tree based solutions or sweep order by plate height; often O(n log n) — the bucket-moving insight changes.

## Q6: How do you solve 'max volume between buildings' (histogram water)?
**A:** 'Trapping rain water' exactly: by bar heights; two-pointer or stack. Summarise both.

## Q7: What is the 'largest rectangle in histogram' vs 'container'?
**A:** Histogram: find the largest rectangle — a monotonic stack O(n). Container: largest area between two chosen bars — two pointers. Distinguish correctly.

## Q8: How do you solve the 'cold storage' matrix variant (2D water)?
**A:** 3D water trap: priority queue seeded at boundary, relax interior with the current water level (BFS + min-heap). O(nm log nm).

## Q9: Why does moving the taller line break the two-pointer invariant?
**A:** The taller line may externally enable a better partner; removing it prematurely forfeits that — the invariant relies on moving the limit.

## Q10: How do you verify container correctness on edge cases?
**A:** Test empty (0), one line (0), all equal (max area = n-1 in width), descending, and negative-in-line reject — the boundary checks an interviewer wants.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 02 container problems technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 02 container problems problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 02 container problems problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 02 container problems implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 02 container problems code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 02 container problems.
**A:** Analogy: 02 container problems is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 02 container problems?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 02 container problems?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 container problems.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 02 container problems asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 container problems. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 02 container problems asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

# Graphs — Shortest Path Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: State Dijkstra's algorithm and its use.
**A:** Dijkstra finds single-source shortest paths in graphs with non-negative weights using a min-priority-queue, relaxing edges from the min-distance vertex. O((V+E) log V).

## Q2: Why does Dijkstra fail with negative edges?
**A:** A vertex's distance is finalised on extraction, but a later negative edge could reduce it — therefore it must not rely on 'extracted = final' when negative weights exist.

## Q3: What is the Bellman-Ford algorithm and its complexity?
**A:** Relaxes all edges V-1 times guaranteeing shortest paths even for negative weights; detects negative cycles on the V-th pass. O(V·E).

## Q4: What is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm?
**A:** All-pairs shortest paths using DP over intermediate vertices k: dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k]+dist[k][j]). O(V^3); handles negative weights but not negative cycles.

## Q5: When do you choose each shortest-path algorithm?
**A:** Unweighted → BFS; non-negative → Dijkstra; negative weights → Bellman-Ford; all-pairs or small V → Floyd-Warshall; 0/1 weights → 0-1 BFS. Match the constraint set first.

## Q6: How do you find the shortest path with a printed route?
**A:** Run the chosen algorithm with a parent/predecessor array, then backtrack from the destination to the source and reverse the list. O(path length) for reconstruction.

## Q7: What is the 'cheapest flight within K stops' problem?
**A:** Modified DP/Bellman-Ford: loop k times relaxing edges with a temp array; answer is the reachable min after K iterations — prevents reusing the same edge within one batch.

## Q8: How do you solve 'network delay time'?
**A:** Dijkstra from source; result = max of reachable distances; if some vertex unreachable, return -1. Tests Dijkstra mastery directly.

## Q9: What is the path-with-max-probability variant?
**A:** Negate to log/sum problem: maximise sum of log(prob) = shortest path on transformed weights via Dijkstra. Common probabilistic-graph interview twist.

## Q10: How do you handle weighted adjacency in Dijkstra with negative like zero?
**A:** You cannot — Dijkstra requires non-negativity. Reframe weights (offset) or switch to Bellman-Ford if any negative edge exists.

## Q11: What is the two-constraint shortest path pattern?
**A:** When the path has two resources (cost + time), DP over one dimension with minimised other (e.g., dp[vertex][cost]=min time) is common — as in 'Cheapest Flights within K stops'.

## Q12: How do you compute the number of shortest paths?
**A:** During Dijkstra/BFS, topK-counters: if relaxed strictly, reset count; if equal, add counts. Track modulo for large answers.

## Q13: What is the negative-weight-cycle consequence?
**A:** If reachable, distances are −∞ (can loop indefinitely to reduce cost); detected by a further relaxation change — the classic Bellman-Ford pass V.

## Q14: How do you apply A* and when does it help?
**A:** A* is Dijkstra plus a heuristic h(n) ≤ true cost toward the goal; with an admissible heuristic it expands fewer nodes for single-target search (map routing).

## Q15: What is the space/time profile for Floyd-Warshall?
**A:** O(V^3) time and O(V^2) space for the distance matrix — feasible only for modest V (≤ 1000).

## Q16: What is the intuition behind the 03 shortest path technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q17: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 03 shortest path problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q18: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 03 shortest path problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q19: What common edge cases must be handled in 03 shortest path implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q20: How would you dry-run your 03 shortest path code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q21: Give a real-world analogy for 03 shortest path.
**A:** Analogy: 03 shortest path is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q22: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 03 shortest path?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q23: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 03 shortest path?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q24: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 03 shortest path.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q25: How is 03 shortest path asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

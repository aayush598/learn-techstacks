# Linked Lists — Doubly Linked List Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: Define a doubly linked list node.
**A:** A node holds data, a next pointer, and a prev pointer. Traversal works both directions; deletion of a known node is O(1) without needing its predecessor.

## Q2: What is the extra cost of a doubly linked list?
**A:** One extra pointer per node (memory and cache pressure), plus more pointer updates on insertion/deletion compared to singly linked lists.

## Q3: How do you insert at the head of a DLL?
**A:** new.prev=None; new.next=head; if head: head.prev=new; head=new; also update tail for empty list. O(1).

## Q4: How do you delete a node known by pointer in a DLL?
**A:** node.prev.next = node.next; node.next.prev = node.prev; then free. O(1) because both neighbours are reachable — this is the DLL's key win over singly.

## Q5: How do you implement a LRU cache with a DLL + hash map?
**A:** Hash map key -> node. Get: move node to head. Put: if exists update+move; else add at head, evict tail when full. O(1) for both using head/tail sentinels.

## Q6: Why are sentinels (dummy head/tail) standard in DLL code?
**A:** They eliminate null-checks on prev/next during removal and movement, reducing edge-case bugs substantially in LRU-style problems.

## Q7: How do you reverse a doubly linked list?
**A:** Swap each node's prev and next while traversing; at the end, swap head and tail. O(n).

## Q8: How do you remove the last element (tail) O(1)?
**A:** Given tail pointer: tail = tail.prev; tail.next = None. Guard for single-node lists. LRU eviction uses exactly this.

## Q9: Name the classic DLL-based problems.
**A:** LRU Cache, LFU Cache (with frequency buckets), design of text editors / undo, browser navigation history, and union/find-adjacent operations.

## Q10: How do you convert a DLL to a circular DLL?
**A:** Connect head.prev = tail and tail.next = head. Afterwards traversal can wrap; mark clearly during algorithms to avoid infinite loops.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 02 doubly linked list technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 02 doubly linked list problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 02 doubly linked list problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 02 doubly linked list implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 02 doubly linked list code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 02 doubly linked list.
**A:** Analogy: 02 doubly linked list is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 02 doubly linked list?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 02 doubly linked list?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 doubly linked list.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 02 doubly linked list asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q98: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 02 doubly linked list? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 doubly linked list. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 02 doubly linked list asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

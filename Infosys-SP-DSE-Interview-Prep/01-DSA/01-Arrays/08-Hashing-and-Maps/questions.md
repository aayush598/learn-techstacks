# Arrays — Hashing And Maps Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is hashing and why use it in array problems?
**A:** Mapping keys to array indices via a hash function for O(1) average lookup — trading space for speed in counting, dedup, and pair-finding problems.

## Q2: What is the difference between a hash set and a hash map?
**A:** Set stores unique keys (membership); map stores key→value pairs (counts, indices, metadata). Array-driven interview problems usually need the map.

## Q3: How does collision resolution work?
**A:** Separate chaining (linked lists/buckets per index) or open addressing (linear/quadratic probing) — maintain the search-slots invariant; Python dict uses open addressing with perturbed probing.

## Q4: What is the load factor?
**A:** The ratio of entries to buckets; growing/rehashing the table once it exceeds a threshold (Python ~2/3) keeps the average probe count near O(1).

## Q5: How do you find the first non-repeating character using hashing?
**A:** Two passes: count frequencies, then rescan for the first char with count 1 — O(n) time, O(1) space for bounded alphabets.

## Q6: How do you find a pair with target sum using a map?
**A:** One pass storing value→index; on each element check target-x in the map — the canonical two-sum hash solution, O(n).

## Q7: What is a perfect hash and array-index trick?
**A:** When keys are dense small integers, a plain array of size max+1 acts as a perfect hash — no collisions, O(1) always; the counting-sort bucket idea.

## Q8: How do you detect duplicates in O(n) with hashing?
**A:** Insert into a set while scanning; the first element already in it is a duplicate — replacing the O(n^2) nested compare.

## Q9: What are the worst-case weaknesses of hashing?
**A:** A bad hash function or a crafted collision flood degrades to O(n) per op — the reason language runtimes randomise hashes for security (hash-flooding defence).

## Q10: How does hashing apply to sliding-window distinct counts?
**A:** A map of char→frequency tracks the window's contents; increment the entering, decrement the leaving, drop keys at zero — keeping distinct count O(1)-able.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 08 hashing and maps technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 08 hashing and maps problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 08 hashing and maps problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 08 hashing and maps implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 08 hashing and maps code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 08 hashing and maps.
**A:** Analogy: 08 hashing and maps is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 08 hashing and maps?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 08 hashing and maps?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 08 hashing and maps.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 08 hashing and maps asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q98: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 08 hashing and maps? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 08 hashing and maps. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 08 hashing and maps asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

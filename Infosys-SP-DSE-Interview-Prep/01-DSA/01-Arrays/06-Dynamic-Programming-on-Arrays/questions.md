1. **What is dynamic programming on arrays?**
   - Computing array problems by combining overlapping subarray solutions stored in a DP table — classic examples: maximum subarray, stock problems, LIS, and subarray sums.

2. **What is the maximum subarray (Kadane's) problem?**
   - Track best sum ending at i: dp[i] = max(arr[i], dp[i-1]+arr[i]); answer = max(dp) — O(n) time, O(1) space using a running variable.

3. **What is the longest increasing subsequence and its DP?**
   - dp[i] = length of LIS ending at i = 1 + max(dp[j]) over j<i with arr[j]<arr[i] — O(n^2); the patience-sorting variant uses binary search to reach O(n log n).

4. **What is the house-robber pattern?**
   - dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+arr[i]) — take-or-skip recurrence; the two-state rolling-variable version drops space to O(1).

5. **What is the jump-game take-or-skip question?**
   - Reachability DP from the last index: can_reach[i] = min over jumps reaching a reachable index — or the greedy O(n) max-reach variant; state both.

6. **How do you count subarrays with a given property using prefix sums?**
   - prefix[r] - prefix[l] == target ⇔ prefix[r] == target + prefix[l]; count with a hash map of seen prefix sums — O(n) for sum-related subarray counts.

7. **What is the maximum profit stock (single transaction) question?**
   - Track min-so-far and profit = max(profit, price - min_so_far) — a single-pass O(n); multiple transactions use the state-machine (hold/sold) DP.

8. **How do you decide a DP state for an array problem?**
   - Ask: 'does the answer at i depend on subanswers at i-1/i-2 (1D) or on a pair of indices (2D range) or a previous state like 'holding'?' — the state definition drives the recurrence.

9. **What is the difference between greedy and DP on arrays?**
   - Greedy (jump game II, stock once) makes a single best local choice each step; DP evaluates both options via subproblem references — use DP when greedy lacks a proof.

10. **What are the space-optimisation tricks?**
   - Store only the last two DP values where each step only reads dp[i-1]/dp[i-2]; use rolling arrays for 2D grids — dropping space without changing time.

11. **What is the intuition behind the 06 dynamic programming on arrays technique used in coding interviews?**
   - The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

12. **Write the brute-force approach for a typical 06 dynamic programming on arrays problem and analyse it.**
   - Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

13. **State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 06 dynamic programming on arrays problems.**
   - The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

14. **What common edge cases must be handled in 06 dynamic programming on arrays implementations?**
   - Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

15. **How would you dry-run your 06 dynamic programming on arrays code on a small example in an interview?**
   - Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

16. **Give a real-world analogy for 06 dynamic programming on arrays.**
   - Analogy: 06 dynamic programming on arrays is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

17. **How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 06 dynamic programming on arrays?**
   - Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

18. **What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 06 dynamic programming on arrays?**
   - Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

19. **Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 06 dynamic programming on arrays.**
   - First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

20. **How is 06 dynamic programming on arrays asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?**
   - In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

21. **What is the intuition behind the 06 dynamic programming on arrays technique used in coding interviews? Extend your answer with a second example.**

   - Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

95. **How would you dry-run your 06 dynamic programming on arrays code on a small example in an interview? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

96. **Give a real-world analogy for 06 dynamic programming on arrays. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Analogy: 06 dynamic programming on arrays is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

97. **How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 06 dynamic programming on arrays? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

98. **What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 06 dynamic programming on arrays? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

99. **Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 06 dynamic programming on arrays. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

100. **How is 06 dynamic programming on arrays asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

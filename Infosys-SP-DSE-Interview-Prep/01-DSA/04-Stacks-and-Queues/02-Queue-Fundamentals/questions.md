# Stacks And Queues — Queue Fundamentals Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: Define a queue.
**A:** A FIFO (first-in-first-out) structure with enqueue (rear) and dequeue (front); used wherever order of arrival must be preserved.

## Q2: How do you implement a queue with a circular array?
**A:** front/back indices with modulo; enqueue at rear, dequeue at front; full when (rear+1)%cap == front. Avoids shifting costs of a naive array queue.

## Q3: How do you implement a queue using two stacks?
**A:** Enqueue pushes into stack A; dequeue pops from stack B, filling B from A when empty. Amortised O(1) behaviour.

## Q4: What is a deque and why is it the preferred Python queue?
**A:** Double-ended queue — O(1) append/pop at both ends; collection.deque is implemented as a doubly-linked block structure, ideal for sliding windows and BFS.

## Q5: Compare BFS's queue usage with DFS's stack usage.
**A:** BFS explores level by level (FIFO queue); DFS explores depth-first (LIFO stack or recursion); both are O(V+E) but ordering differs.

## Q6: How does a priority queue differ from a normal queue?
**A:** Serves the highest (or lowest) priority element first, not FIFO; implemented with binary heaps giving O(log n) insert/delete-min.

## Q7: What is a blocking queue and where is it used?
**A:** Blocks enqueue when full and dequeue when empty; used in producer-consumer patterns and thread pools (Python queue.Queue).

## Q8: How do you check if two queue lookalikes (stack vs queue) by operations?
**A:** Distinguish by observing removal order: if results preserve insertion order it's a queue, if reversed it's a stack.

## Q9: How many nodes does BFS visit at max, and what's the space complexity?
**A:** Space is O(W) for the frontier, worst O(V) — since all vertices could be enqueued; time O(V+E) with adjacency lists.

## Q10: What are the common queue applications in OS/network stacks?
**A:** Process scheduling (FIFO/round-robin queues), packet buffer queues, print spooling, message queues — all preserve order and smooth bursts.

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 02 queue fundamentals technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 02 queue fundamentals problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 02 queue fundamentals problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 02 queue fundamentals implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 02 queue fundamentals code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 02 queue fundamentals.
**A:** Analogy: 02 queue fundamentals is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 02 queue fundamentals?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 02 queue fundamentals?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 queue fundamentals.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 02 queue fundamentals asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 queue fundamentals. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 02 queue fundamentals asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

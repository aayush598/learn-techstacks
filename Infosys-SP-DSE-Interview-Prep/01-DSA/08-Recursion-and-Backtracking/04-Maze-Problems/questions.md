# Recursion And Backtracking — Maze Problems Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: How do you find a path in a maze with DFS?
**A:** DFS from start, moving 4-directional within bounds, marking visited and restoring; on reaching the end, record the path. O(MN) for a single path.

## Q2: How do you count all paths in a maze from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1)?
**A:** dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1] with obstacles zeroed — the grid-DP formula; BFS-alternative counts work for many obstacles too.

## Q3: How do you find the shortest path in a binary maze?
**A:** BFS from start tracking distance; answer is the distance of the end. Obstacles skip; O(MN).

## Q4: How do you detect a valid staircase/stair in a word maze?
**A:** Model as graph traversal with directional constraints — check cell content vs constraints and track visited states. O(MN).

## Q5: How do rat-in-a-maze variants handle 'can revisit' vs not?
**A:** Standard: cells not revisited (visited set). Variants allow revisits → search becomes unbounded and needs constraints (must use DP with state including position only).

## Q6: How do you solve 'paths with max collect' (maze with black/white)?
**A:** DP on a grid collecting rewards with the monotonic property; value at cell accumulates max of predecessors. O(MN) using DP not DFS.

## Q7: How do you handle huge mazes (10^4 cells)?
**A:** Iterative BFS/DP avoids recursion overflow; space stays O(MN) for distances but avoid full visited matrix when directions constrain (use distance array).

## Q8: What do you do when the maze has teleporters / portals?
**A:** Each portal adds extra directed edges; BFS/Dijkstra over the augmented graph takes teleports as 0-cost transitions. O(V+E).

## Q9: How do you solve the 'robot return to origin' style (path verification)?
**A:** Only coordinate deltas matter: track x,y accumulating (x+=1 etc.), return True iff both zero. O(n) — not really a graph algorithm.

## Q10: How do you solve the 'unique-path with exactly K steps' (grid)?
**A:** DP over steps: dp[steps][r][c] summing predecessor paths; or matrix exponentiation for many steps. O(k·MN).

## Q11: What is the intuition behind the 04 maze problems technique used in coding interviews?
**A:** The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

## Q12: Write the brute-force approach for a typical 04 maze problems problem and analyse it.
**A:** Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

## Q13: State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 04 maze problems problems.
**A:** The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

## Q14: What common edge cases must be handled in 04 maze problems implementations?
**A:** Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

## Q15: How would you dry-run your 04 maze problems code on a small example in an interview?
**A:** Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

## Q16: Give a real-world analogy for 04 maze problems.
**A:** Analogy: 04 maze problems is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

## Q17: How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 04 maze problems?
**A:** Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

## Q18: What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 04 maze problems?
**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q19: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 04 maze problems.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q20: How is 04 maze problems asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

**A:** Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

## Q99: Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 04 maze problems. Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

## Q100: How is 04 maze problems asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview? Extend your answer with a second example.
**A:** In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

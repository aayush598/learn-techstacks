1. **What is backtracking and its general framework?**
   - Recursively build a candidate incrementally; if the partial candidate is invalid or can't lead to a solution, backtrack (undo last choice). Enumerate all valid configurations.

2. **How do you generate all permutations of a string/array?**
   - Swap-based: for each position i, swap with each future j and recurse on i+1, swapping back after — O(n!). Dedupe with a set for repeated characters.

3. **How do you generate all subsets (powerset)?**
   - Bitmask for small n (2^n) or recursive pick/skip. Both O(2^n); the recursive one naturally orders lexicographically if choices sorted.

4. **How do you generate combinations of size k?**
   - Recur(index, combination): for i from index..n-k+len; add, recur(i+1), remove — prune when the remainder can't fill the size. O(C(n,k)).

5. **How do you solve N-Queens with backtracking?**
   - Place a queen per row; validity checks via column and two diagonals (sets/boolean arrays prevents attacks). Backtrack on conflict. O(n!) worst-case but with pruning.

6. **How do you solve Sudoku?**
   - Choose an empty cell with smallest candidates (MRV heuristic), try candidate digits, validate row/col/box, recurse; backtrack on dead-ends. Worst-case exponential but pruned heavily.

7. **What is the key to deduplicating permutations with repeated elements?**
   - Sort the input and skip reusing the same value at the same position in one level of the loop (e.g., if i>pos and nums[i]==nums[i-1]: continue) — a classic dedupe suffix.

8. **How do you find all combinations that sum to a target?**
   - Sort, recur with pick/skip; skip duplicate values at the same level; allow reuse by calling back at the same index for unbounded, and i+1 for 0/1 usage.

9. **How do you generate phone-letter combinations?**
   - Digit-character map; depth-first over the digits appending choices; base case when index == len(digits). O(4^n · 3^m) outputs.

10. **What is the meeting-point between backtracking and DFS?**
   - Backtracking = DFS over an implicit decision tree with constraint pruning. The tree is not materialised; the recursion conducts the search with state restore.

11. **How do you solve 'word search' with backtracking?**
   - For each start cell run DFS in 4 directions building the word, marking the current cell as visited in-situ and restoring after — a board-DFS.

12. **How do you solve the 'letter tile possibilities' count?**
   - Count arrangements from a multiset: recur over distinct characters with remaining counts = freq loop; total counts all length permutations. O(unique · 2^n) states.

13. **When does backtracking become intolerant of large inputs?**
   - Whenever the search space is exponential in n (permutations/combinations/subset); the problem sets typically cap n ≤ 10-12 for brute-force backtracking.

14. **How do you generate parentheses combinations?**
   - Recur(open, close, cur): add '(' if open < n, add ')' if close < open — pruning invalid prefix; base when len==2n. Catalan-bounded output.

15. **How do you solve 'combination sum with limited repetitions'?**
   - Cap counts per value with a freq array; extended pick/skip respecting remaining copies — a bounded-unbounded hybrid.

16. **What is the intuition behind the 02 permutations and combinations technique used in coding interviews?**
   - The core idea is to avoid brute force by exploiting structure: leftover wasted compares are removed, and each element is processed a small constant number of times, driving complexity down to an optimal bound that interviewers expect you to justify.

17. **Write the brute-force approach for a typical 02 permutations and combinations problem and analyse it.**
   - Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

18. **State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 02 permutations and combinations problems.**
   - The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

19. **What common edge cases must be handled in 02 permutations and combinations implementations?**
   - Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

20. **How would you dry-run your 02 permutations and combinations code on a small example in an interview?**
   - Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

21. **Give a real-world analogy for 02 permutations and combinations.**
   - Analogy: 02 permutations and combinations is like scanning a line of people for a specific property while remembering a few key facts — each person is visited once and relevant state is carried forward, exactly how the optimal solution behaves.

22. **How do you decide between a hash map, sorting, or two pointers as tools for 02 permutations and combinations?**
   - Hash map when you need membership/paired lookup in O(1) and space is affordable; sorting when order gives a monotonic advantage (two pointers, binary search); pointers directly when the input is already sorted. Trade space for speed only when constraints allow.

23. **What is the role of a prefix/suffix precomputation in 02 permutations and combinations?**
   - Precomputation turns repeated subcomputations into O(1) lookups, converting an O(n^2) nested loop into O(n). Common wherever the value at index i depends on an aggregate over a range around i.

24. **Explain the optimisation step you would mention after writing the naive version for 02 permutations and combinations.**
   - First remove redundant recomputation via memoisation or prefix arrays; next, exploit monotonicity with two pointers/sliding window; finally, reduce space by keeping running variables instead of full tables — always closing with the improved complexity.

25. **How is 02 permutations and combinations asked differently in an online assessment versus a live interview?**
   - In the assessment only correctness/speed of the final code matters and hidden tests matter; in the live round the interviewer wants your thought process, complexity analysis, edge cases, and a hand trace — both must be practiced.

26. **What is the intuition behind the 02 permutations and combinations technique used in coding interviews? Extend your answer with a second example.**

   - Brute force enumerates every candidate configuration, e.g., every subarray/combination/permutation, giving O(n^2), O(n^3) or O(2^n). It is correct but only useful for small inputs; the interview follow-up is to optimise it to linear or O(n log n).

98. **State the time and space complexity of the optimal solution for most 02 permutations and combinations problems. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - The optimal solution is usually O(n) time with O(n) space, or O(n) time with O(1) space when a monotonic/pointer trick applies. Always state constants and best/worst cases explicitly.

99. **What common edge cases must be handled in 02 permutations and combinations implementations? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Empty input, single-element input, all-equal values, negative numbers, duplicates, off-by-one at the last index, and large values where intermediate sums/products can overflow — every one must be tested.

100. **How would you dry-run your 02 permutations and combinations code on a small example in an interview? Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - Pick a tiny input, walk index by index while updating each variable, and show the invariants hold at every step. This proves both correctness and that you truly understand the algorithm, which Infosys interviewers probe by asking you to trace code by hand.

1. **What is an AI agent?**
   - An LLM-driven loop that reasons, calls tools, observes results, and iterates toward a goal — autonomous decision-making beyond one-shot completion.

2. **What is the difference between a chatbot and an agent?**
   - A chatbot responds once to a query; an agent plans multiple steps, invokes tools/functions, and adapts based on environment feedback until the task finishes.

3. **What are the components of an agent?**
   - The LLM brain (orchestrator), tools (functions/APIs), memory (short/long-term), observation/state, and the loop controller — each pluggable.

4. **What is the agent loop (ReAct pattern)?**
   - Reason (plan the next step) -> act (call a tool) -> observe (feed the result back) -> repeat until goal — the map of thinking out loud with tools.

5. **What is single vs multi-agent?**
   - Single agent: one brain with many tools. Multi-agent: specialised sub-agents (researcher, coder, reviewer) supervised by a planner — decomposing complex goals.

6. **What is the plan-then-execute pattern?**
   - Decompose the goal into an explicit plan first, then execute steps (re-planning on failure) — more predictable than pure reactive loops.

7. **What is memory in agents — short vs long-term?**
   - Short-term: current conversation/state context. Long-term: evictions to a vector store/knowledge across sessions — retrieval makes memory scalable.

8. **What is the difference between a workflow and an agent?**
   - A workflow is a fixed, hand-authored sequence; an agent decides the path dynamically at runtime — workflows for stable tasks, agents for open-ended ones.

9. **What is observability crucial in agentic apps?**
   - Every step's reasoning, tool call, and latency must be traceable — debugging agents is debugging dialogues; logging is non-negotiable.

10. **What is the reliability problem with agents?**
   - Free-form tool selection can loop, misuse tools, or leak context; mitigations: structured tool schemas, budgets/steps caps, validation, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

11. **Define 01 agentic ai basics in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 01 agentic ai basics is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 01 agentic ai basics important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 agentic ai basics?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 01 agentic ai basics with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 agentic ai basics knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 01 agentic ai basics?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 agentic ai basics?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 01 agentic ai basics as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 01 agentic ai basics interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 01 agentic ai basics is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 01 agentic ai basics in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

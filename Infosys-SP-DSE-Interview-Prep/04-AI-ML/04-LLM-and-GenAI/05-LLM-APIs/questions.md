1. **What are the main LLM API families?**
   - OpenAI (GPT-4o-series, embeddings), Google (Gemini on Vertex/AI Studio), Anthropic (Claude), OpenRouter for unified access — chat/completions + embeddings endpoints.

2. **What is the chat completions structure?**
   - POST with messages=[{role: system/user/assistant, content}], model, temperature; returns choices with content — the omnipresent API shape.

3. **What is function/tool calling in LLM APIs?**
   - The model emits a structured function-call (name + args) instead of plain text; your app runs it and feeds the result back — the foundation of agentic apps.

4. **What is structured output / response format?**
   - JSON-schema-validation (or JSON mode) forcing the model's output into a schema — reliable programmatic consumption without parsing gymnastics.

5. **What is embeddings API usage?**
   - POST to the embeddings endpoint returning vector lists per input — powering the retrieval stores and similarity logic of RAG.

6. **What is streaming and why use it?**
   - Incremental tokens over SSE — low time-to-first-token perceived latency and progressive UI rendering for chat apps.

7. **How do you manage API keys, rate limits, and retries?**
   - Env/secret injection, exponential backoff on 429, token-budget accounting — the production-hardening practices interviewers ask about.

8. **What is the cost/time profile of a call?**
   - Bill by prompt+completion tokens; latency scales with output length; batching/caching reduce spend — calculate per-request economics for products.

9. **What is model caching or prompt caching?**
   - Providers cache repeated prefixes (system prompts, few-shots) at a discount — big savings for stable RAG/agent system prompts.

10. **What is the difference between a provider-agnostic layer and direct SDKs?**
   - wrappers (OpenRouter, LiteLLM) normalise APIs across providers — resume-visible engineering of swapping models without code rewrites.

11. **Define 05 llm apis in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 05 llm apis is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 05 llm apis important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 05 llm apis?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 05 llm apis with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 05 llm apis knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 05 llm apis?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 05 llm apis?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 05 llm apis as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 05 llm apis interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 05 llm apis is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 05 llm apis in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - One line: 05 llm apis is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

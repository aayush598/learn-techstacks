# Deep Learning — Cnn Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is a convolution operation?
**A:** Sliding a small filter over the input computing dot products — detecting local patterns (edges, textures) with weight sharing; the CNN building block.

## Q2: What is a convolutional layer?
**A:** Multiple filters produce feature maps; strides control step size; padding preserves spatial dims. Each filter learns one local pattern.

## Q3: What are the components of a CNN?
**A:** Conv layers (feature extraction) + pooling (downsampling) + fully-connected head (classification); batchnorm and dropout interleave — the LeNet-AlexNet lineage.

## Q4: What is pooling and its types?
**A:** Max pooling (activations, noise-robust, default) and average pooling (smoothing) downsample, adding translation invariance and shrinking compute.

## Q5: What is the receptive field?
**A:** The input region a neuron sees — deeper layers aggregate wider context; stacking convolutions grows it without huge kernels.

## Q6: What is stride and padding?
**A:** Stride: filter step (controls output size); padding 'same' preserves spatial dims, 'valid' shrinks them — both tune downsampling.

## Q7: What are known CNN architectures?
**A:** LeNet (1998), AlexNet, VGG (deep small kernels), ResNet (residuals), Inception, EfficientNet — name ResNet's skip connections as the modern turning point.

## Q8: What is the difference between a fully-connected and convolutional layer?
**A:** FC: full connections, spatially agnostic, parameter heavy. Conv: local receptive fields, weight sharing, translation-equivariant — ideal for images.

## Q9: What data augmentation for CNNs?
**A:** Rotation, flip, crop, colour jitter, noise — teaching invariance and extending the effective dataset cheaply.

## Q10: What is transfer learning with CNNs?
**A:** Fine-tune pre-trained ImageNet backbones (ResNet, EfficientNet) — freezing early layers and retraining the head for new datasets efficiently.

## Q11: What is a 1x1 convolution?
**A:** A point-wise conv mixing channels while keeping spatial dims — cheap dimensionality mixing used in Inception/ResNet bottleneck blocks.

## Q12: What are limitations of CNNs?
**A:** Local receptive fields (hard to capture global context without depth), fixed grid assumption, and large data needs; attention models address some of these.

## Q13: Define 02 cnn in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 02 cnn is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q14: Why is 02 cnn important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q15: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 02 cnn?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q16: Compare 02 cnn with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q17: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 02 cnn knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q18: What common misconceptions exist about 02 cnn?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q19: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 02 cnn?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q20: Describe 02 cnn as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q21: How does 02 cnn interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q22: What would you change about how 02 cnn is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

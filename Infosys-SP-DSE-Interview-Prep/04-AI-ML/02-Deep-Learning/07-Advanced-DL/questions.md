# Deep Learning — Advanced Dl Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is a GAN?
**A:** A generator fakes data vs a discriminator detecting fakes in adversarial training — converging to realistic samples; used for synthetic data and image translation.

## Q2: What is a diffusion model?
**A:** Trained by adding noise then learning to denoise — iteratively refining samples; the technology behind Stable Diffusion and DALL-E image generation.

## Q3: What is a variational autoencoder (VAE)?
**A:** An encoder producing a latent distribution (mean/var) and a decoder reconstructing; reparameterisation enables gradients — generative and representation learning.

## Q4: What is a Graph Neural Network (GNN)?
**A:** Message passing between connected nodes to learn node/graph representations — powering recommendation, molecule, and fraud graph tasks.

## Q5: What are embeddings and how are they learned?
**A:** Dense low-dimensional vectors representing entities (words, users, items) so similar things are near each other — learned end-to-end or via matrix factorisation.

## Q6: What is knowledge distillation?
**A:** Training a small student to mimic a large teacher's softened outputs — compressing models with minimal accuracy loss; one of the efficiency techniques.

## Q7: What is model quantisation?
**A:** Lowering weight precision (FP16/INT8) shrinking memory and speeding inference at slight accuracy cost — the deployment trick for large-nets-on-edge.

## Q8: What is pruning?
**A:** Dropping low-magnitude weights/neurons to slim a model — combined with quantisation for aggressive compression.

## Q9: What is continual/incremental learning?
**A:** Learning over a stream of tasks without forgetting prior ones — replay buffers, regularisation penalties, or modular networks; an active research area.

## Q10: What is self-supervised learning?
**A:** Pre-training using the data itself as supervision (next-word prediction, masked pixels) — the paradigm behind BERT/GPT reducing labelled-data needs.

## Q11: Define 07 advanced dl in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 07 advanced dl is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q12: Why is 07 advanced dl important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q13: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 07 advanced dl?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q14: Compare 07 advanced dl with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q15: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 07 advanced dl knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q16: What common misconceptions exist about 07 advanced dl?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q17: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 07 advanced dl?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q18: Describe 07 advanced dl as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q19: How does 07 advanced dl interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q20: What would you change about how 07 advanced dl is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

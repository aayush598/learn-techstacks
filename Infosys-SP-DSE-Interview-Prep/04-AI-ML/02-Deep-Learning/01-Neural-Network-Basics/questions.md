1. **What is a neuron/perceptron?**
   - A weighted sum of inputs passed through a non-linear activation: y = activation(w·x + b). Stacked and chained, these form deep networks.

2. **What are activation functions and common choices?**
   - ReLU (fast, sparse, default hidden), sigmoid (0-1 output), tanh (-1..1), softmax (probabilities); each has gradient regimes — ReLU dominates hidden layers.

3. **What is a loss function in DL?**
   - A scalar quantifying prediction error minimised by training — cross-entropy for classification, MSE/MAE for regression; choice shapes the gradients.

4. **What is backpropagation?**
   - The chain rule applied backward through the graph computing gradients of the loss w.r.t. every weight — the training engine behind all DL.

5. **What is a gradient descent and its variants?**
   - SGD (one sample), mini-batch SGD (batch), Momentum/Adam (adaptive) — the optimiser family; Adam is the pragmatic default in modern training.

6. **What is overfitting in a neural net?**
   - High capacity memorises training noise; diagnosed by train/val divergence; fixed with regularisation, augmentation, dropout, early stopping, more data.

7. **What is the vanishing/exploding gradient problem?**
   - Gradients multiply across layers tending to 0 or infinity; mitigated by ReLU/leaky-ReLU, normalised initialisation, batchnorm, skip connections, and residual blocks.

8. **What is an epoch, batch, and iteration?**
   - Epoch: one full pass over data. Batch: a chunk per update. Iteration: one batch step per epoch = samples/batch_size — the training-loop vocabulary.

9. **What is a learning rate and how is it chosen?**
   - Step size of weight updates; too high diverges, too low stalls — schedule/decay and Adam's adaptive rates handle much of the tuning.

10. **What is the difference between hyperparameters and parameters?**
   - Parameters are learned weights; hyperparameters (layers, lr, batch size) are set by the engineer and tuned by validation.

11. **What is GPU acceleration in training?**
   - Massively parallel matrix ops the CUDA/cuDNN stack accelerates; batching utilises the GPU, memory (VRAM) caps batch size — the practical training bottleneck discussion.

12. **What is weight initialisation?**
   - Setting starting weights to avoid symmetry and vanishing gradients (He/Xavier); wrong init stalls training regardless of later optimisation.

13. **Define 01 neural network basics in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 01 neural network basics is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

14. **Why is 01 neural network basics important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

15. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 neural network basics?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

16. **Compare 01 neural network basics with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

17. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 neural network basics knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

18. **What common misconceptions exist about 01 neural network basics?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

19. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 neural network basics?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

20. **Describe 01 neural network basics as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

21. **How does 01 neural network basics interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

22. **What would you change about how 01 neural network basics is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

23. **Define 01 neural network basics in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

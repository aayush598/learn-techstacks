# Ml Fundamentals — Supervised Learning Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is supervised learning?
**A:** Learning a mapping from inputs X to labelled outputs Y from (x, y) pairs: classification (discrete classes) or regression (continuous values) — the paradigm behind labelled datasets.

## Q2: What is the difference between classification and regression?
**A:** Classification predicts a discrete class (spam/not-spam, cat/dog); regression predicts a continuous value (price, temperature); loss functions differ (cross-entropy vs MSE).

## Q3: What is a linear regression model?
**A:** y = wx + b fit by minimising squared error; coefficients estimated via ordinary least squares or gradient descent; the interpretable baseline model.

## Q4: What is logistic regression?
**A:** A linear model with a sigmoid squashing the output to a probability between 0 and 1; trained with cross-entropy/negative log-likelihood; a linear classifier, despite the name.

## Q5: What is the difference between a decision tree and a random forest?
**A:** A tree recursively splits on features based on purity (Gini/information gain); a random forest baggs many deep trees with feature subsampling — reducing variance via averaging.

## Q6: What is SVM?
**A:** Support Vector Machine finds the maximum-margin hyperplane separating classes; kernel trick (RBF/polynomial) lifts data into higher dimensions for non-linear boundaries.

## Q7: What is k-NN?
**A:** k-Nearest Neighbours predicts by majority/mean of k nearest training points; lazy (no training), distance-sensitive, scales poorly at inference — a baseline classifier.

## Q8: What is Naive Bayes?
**A:** A generative classifier assuming conditional independence of features; fast, small-data friendly, great for text (bag-of-words probability).

## Q9: What is overfitting and underfitting?
**A:** Overfit: model memorises noise (great train, poor test). Underfit: too simple to capture the pattern (poor both). Diagnosed by the train/test gap and fixed with capacity/complexity tuning.

## Q10: What is bias-variance tradeoff?
**A:** Bias: error from wrong assumptions (underfit). Variance: error from sensitivity to training data (overfit); balancing them is the core of model selection.

## Q11: What is cross-validation and why use it?
**A:** k-fold splits data into folds rotating train/validation — robust performance estimates with limited data, avoiding a lucky/unlucky single split.

## Q12: What is the difference between train/dev/test sets?
**A:** Train fits weights; validation/dev tunes hyperparameters; test measures final generalisation — leakage between them inflates perceived performance.

## Q13: Define 01 supervised learning in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 01 supervised learning is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q14: Why is 01 supervised learning important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q15: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 supervised learning?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q16: Compare 01 supervised learning with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q17: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 supervised learning knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q18: What common misconceptions exist about 01 supervised learning?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q19: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 supervised learning?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q20: Describe 01 supervised learning as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q21: How does 01 supervised learning interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q22: What would you change about how 01 supervised learning is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

1. **What is supervised learning?**
   - Learning a mapping from inputs X to labelled outputs Y from (x, y) pairs: classification (discrete classes) or regression (continuous values) — the paradigm behind labelled datasets.

2. **What is the difference between classification and regression?**
   - Classification predicts a discrete class (spam/not-spam, cat/dog); regression predicts a continuous value (price, temperature); loss functions differ (cross-entropy vs MSE).

3. **What is a linear regression model?**
   - y = wx + b fit by minimising squared error; coefficients estimated via ordinary least squares or gradient descent; the interpretable baseline model.

4. **What is logistic regression?**
   - A linear model with a sigmoid squashing the output to a probability between 0 and 1; trained with cross-entropy/negative log-likelihood; a linear classifier, despite the name.

5. **What is the difference between a decision tree and a random forest?**
   - A tree recursively splits on features based on purity (Gini/information gain); a random forest baggs many deep trees with feature subsampling — reducing variance via averaging.

6. **What is SVM?**
   - Support Vector Machine finds the maximum-margin hyperplane separating classes; kernel trick (RBF/polynomial) lifts data into higher dimensions for non-linear boundaries.

7. **What is k-NN?**
   - k-Nearest Neighbours predicts by majority/mean of k nearest training points; lazy (no training), distance-sensitive, scales poorly at inference — a baseline classifier.

8. **What is Naive Bayes?**
   - A generative classifier assuming conditional independence of features; fast, small-data friendly, great for text (bag-of-words probability).

9. **What is overfitting and underfitting?**
   - Overfit: model memorises noise (great train, poor test). Underfit: too simple to capture the pattern (poor both). Diagnosed by the train/test gap and fixed with capacity/complexity tuning.

10. **What is bias-variance tradeoff?**
   - Bias: error from wrong assumptions (underfit). Variance: error from sensitivity to training data (overfit); balancing them is the core of model selection.

11. **What is cross-validation and why use it?**
   - k-fold splits data into folds rotating train/validation — robust performance estimates with limited data, avoiding a lucky/unlucky single split.

12. **What is the difference between train/dev/test sets?**
   - Train fits weights; validation/dev tunes hyperparameters; test measures final generalisation — leakage between them inflates perceived performance.

13. **Define 01 supervised learning in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 01 supervised learning is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

14. **Why is 01 supervised learning important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

15. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 supervised learning?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

16. **Compare 01 supervised learning with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

17. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 supervised learning knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

18. **What common misconceptions exist about 01 supervised learning?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

19. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 supervised learning?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

20. **Describe 01 supervised learning as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

21. **How does 01 supervised learning interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

22. **What would you change about how 01 supervised learning is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

23. **Define 01 supervised learning in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

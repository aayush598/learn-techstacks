1. **What is caching?**
   - Storing frequently-read results closer to the request — in-memory, CDN, or at the DB — to cut latency and reduce downstream load.

2. **What is caching at which layers of a web app?**
   - Browser caching (HTTP headers), CDN (static), app/in-memory (Redis/memcached for hot reads), DB query cache — each layer offloads the next.

3. **What is a cache-aside (lazy) pattern?**
   - Read: check cache, on miss load from DB and populate. Write: update DB, invalidate the cache. Simple and eventually consistent — the most common pattern.

4. **What is write-through vs write-back caching?**
   - Write-through: every write goes to cache then DB (stronger consistency, higher latency). Write-back: accumulate writes and flush (fast, risk of loss on crash).

5. **What is cache invalidation and the classic problems?**
   - Stale reads after DB updates — solved by TTL, explicit invalidation, or versioned keys; invalidation bugs cause the meanest production bugs.

6. **What is a TTL and why set it?**
   - Time-to-live expires entries automatically — bounding staleness; choose per data volatility (config: minutes, user profile: hours, posts: seconds).

7. **What is a cache stampede (thundering herd)?**
   - A hot key expires and N requests all hit the DB — mitigated by locks/single-flight, stale-while-revalidate, or probabilistic expiry.

8. **What is an LRU cache?**
   - Least-Recently-Used eviction: remove the oldest entry when capacity is exhausted — the standard in-memory eviction policy (Redis/LRU, your C++ LRU).

9. **What is Redis and its use as a cache?**
   - A fast in-memory data store (strings/hashes/ttl) shared across instances — the backbone cache/queue/session store for scaled apps.

10. **What is the local vs distributed cache trade-off?**
   - Local: zero network, per-instance duplication. Distributed (Redis): shared, consistent, one more failure domain — pick by scale and consistency needs.

11. **What do you cache in an AI API product?**
   - Prompt/system prefixes, retrieved chunks, and generated response hashes — massive latency/cost savings in RAG and LLM products.

12. **Define 03 caching in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 03 caching is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 03 caching important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 03 caching?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 03 caching with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 03 caching knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 03 caching?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 03 caching?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 03 caching as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 03 caching interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 03 caching is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 03 caching in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

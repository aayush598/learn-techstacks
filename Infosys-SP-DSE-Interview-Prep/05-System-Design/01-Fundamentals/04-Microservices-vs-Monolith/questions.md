1. **What is a monolith?**
   - One deployable containing all features — simple to build/debug/start, but it scales as one unit and couples teams' releases.

2. **What is microservices?**
   - Independent services, each owning its data, communicating over HTTP/messages, deployed separately — scalable, fault-isolated, and team-aligned.

3. **What are the trade-offs of microservices?**
   - Pros: independent scaling/deploys, organisational alignment, tech freedom. Cons: distributed debugging, network latency, data consistency, ops complexity.

4. **What are the patterns for microservices communication?**
   - Synchronous REST/gRPC for request-response; async message queues/events (Kafka) for decoupling; each has consistency and failure semantics.

5. **What is the database per service principle?**
   - Each service owns its schema — no shared DB access, preserving autonomy; cross-service reads use APIs/events/eventual consistency.

6. **What is an API gateway's role?**
   - Single entry: routing, auth, rate limiting, and aggregation for a family of services — the facade of the microservice mesh.

7. **What is service discovery?**
   - Dynamic location of service instances via registries (Consul/etcd/cloud DNS) since IPs change with auto-scaling — the glue of distributed calls.

8. **What is the difference between orchestration and choreography?**
   - Orchestration: a central coordinator drives steps (simple, single point of failure). Choreography: services react to events independently (decoupled, harder to trace).

9. **How do you decompose a monolith?**
   - Start from boundaries: bounded-context seams (order vs inventory), extract the most-failed/hottest service first, and use the strangler pattern to incrementally replace.

10. **What is observability across services?**
   - Distributed tracing (trace IDs across hops), structured logs, and metrics — joining a request across services; without it microservices are unoperable.

11. **When would you keep a monolith?**
   - Small team, small company, exploratory stage, or strong domain cohesion — microservices' benefits only pay off past a scaling/org threshold.

12. **Define 04 microservices vs monolith in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 04 microservices vs monolith is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 04 microservices vs monolith important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 04 microservices vs monolith?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 04 microservices vs monolith with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 04 microservices vs monolith knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 04 microservices vs monolith?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 04 microservices vs monolith?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 04 microservices vs monolith as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 04 microservices vs monolith interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 04 microservices vs monolith is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 04 microservices vs monolith in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

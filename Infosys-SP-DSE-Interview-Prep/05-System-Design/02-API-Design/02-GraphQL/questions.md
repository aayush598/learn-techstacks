# Api Design — Graphql Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is GraphQL?
**A:** A query language where clients request exactly the fields they need in one round trip — a single endpoint with a typed schema.

## Q2: What is the core difference between REST and GraphQL?
**A:** REST: resources + server-defined shapes + multiple round trips. GraphQL: client-defined query shapes + one endpoint + a schema enforced by the server.

## Q3: What is a query vs a mutation in GraphQL?
**A:** query reads data (parallelisable, cacheable); mutation writes (executed serially) — the read/write separation of the schema.

## Q4: What is a resolver?
**A:** The function resolving each field — retrieving/transforming data; GraphQL composes a tree of resolvers per query.

## Q5: What is the N+1 problem in GraphQL?
**A:** A list query triggers a resolver per item hitting the DB N+1 times — solved with Dataloader batching/batching per field.

## Q6: What is schema-driven development?
**A:** The schema is the contract defined first; clients and servers type-generate from it — the collaboration pattern teams adopt.

## Q7: What are the trade-offs of GraphQL vs REST?
**A:** GraphQL: precise payloads, fewer round trips, but complex caching, DoS via nested queries, and a harder learning curve — REST simpler and cacheable.

## Q8: What is a GraphQL subscription?
**A:** A subscription is a persistent stream of updates (over WebSocket) — real-time push as opposed to query/mutation's request-response.

## Q9: How do you protect a GraphQL API?
**A:** Query-depth and complexity limits (cost analysis), persisted-queries allowlists, and rate limiting — preventing deeply-nested abusive queries.

## Q10: When would you choose GraphQL?
**A:** Dashboards/mobile apps with differing field needs, many clients — but avoid it if caching/simplicity or a broad REST ecosystem dominates your use case.

## Q11: Define 02 graphql in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 02 graphql is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q12: Why is 02 graphql important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q13: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 02 graphql?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q14: Compare 02 graphql with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q15: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 02 graphql knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q16: What common misconceptions exist about 02 graphql?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q17: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 02 graphql?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q18: Describe 02 graphql as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q19: How does 02 graphql interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q20: What would you change about how 02 graphql is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

## Q21: Define 02 graphql in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.

1. **Design a chat system — the core features?**
   - One-to-one and group messaging, message persistence, delivery order, presence, and online/offline synchronisation — over WebSockets.

2. **What is the transport for real-time messages?**
   - WebSockets for bidirectional push; REST for history/records; the connection is long-lived via load-balanced gateway endpoints.

3. **How do you store messages?**
   - A messages table keyed by conversation_id with (sender, ts, content, status); Power-of-2-style chat isn't needed here — timestamp-ordering IDs are.

4. **How do you order messages correctly?**
   - Server-assigned sequence numbers (or snowflake-style IDs) per conversation, applied at the server, not the client clock — network clocks lie.

5. **What happens to delivery when a user is offline?**
   - Outbox/queue per user; on reconnect, sync missing messages since last_seq — the pull-on-reconnect pattern preserves ordering and durability.

6. **What is the read receipt / delivered model?**
   - Delivery = pushed to gateway; read = user opened the conversation; both are separate status transitions recorded and broadcast.

7. **How do you scale WebSocket connections?**
   - Stateless WebSocket gateways behind an LB (connection-sticky), presence tracked in Redis — rooms shard across gateways with pub/sub broadcasting.

8. **What is a pub/sub for chat rooms?**
   - Redis pub/sub or Kafka per conversation fan-out: server sees one publish, sends to all connected members of that room — the broadcast primitive.

9. **What are the consistency vs availability trade-offs?**
   - Online senders see others' messages via optimistic UI; offline sync reconciles — eventual consistency in ordering is acceptable and standard.

10. **How do you test a chat system?**
   - Concurrent-message ordering, reconnection replay, and large-room fan-out load tests — plus presence flapping under network churn.

11. **Define 04 chat system in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 04 chat system is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 04 chat system important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 04 chat system?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 04 chat system with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 04 chat system knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 04 chat system?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 04 chat system?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 04 chat system as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 04 chat system interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 04 chat system is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 04 chat system in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

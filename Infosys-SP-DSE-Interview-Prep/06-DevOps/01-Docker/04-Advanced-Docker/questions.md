1. **What is Docker networking — bridge, host, none?**
   - bridge (default, NAT isolation), host (shared host network), none (isolated), plus overlay for swarm — choose per exposure needs.

2. **What is Docker volume vs bind mount?**
   - Volumes: managed, portable, stored by Docker. Bind mounts: host path mounted directly (dev). Volumes win for prod data; binds for config dev.

3. **What is an ephemeral vs persisted container?**
   - Ephemeral: all config/state passed in, safe to recreate. Persisted: volumes house DB/upload data — the stateless-container principle in practice.

4. **What is the Docker lifecycle for garbage collection?**
   - docker system prune (dangling images/containers/networks) and volume prune — housekeeping that keeps hosts from filling up.

5. **What are the resource limits you can impose?**
   - --memory, --cpus, and runtime quotas enforce a container's cgroup limits — preventing one app starving the host.

6. **What is Docker's relationship to Kubernetes?**
   - Docker builds/run containers; K8s orchestrates them across nodes — scheduling, service discovery, scaling, self-healing; the packaging vs platform distinction.

7. **What is containerd/runc and where do they sit?**
   - runc creates containers from OCI specs; containerd is the daemon managing runc; Docker uses both underneath — the modern runtime stack.

8. **How do you optimise docker build caching?**
   - Layer order, multi-stage, and BuildKit features (cache mounts for pip) — hitting the cache avoids re-downloading dependencies every build.

9. **What is BuildKit?**
   - The modern Docker build engine — parallel stages, better caching, SSH/secret mounts, and provenance; enabled by default in Docker 23+.

10. **What is the security surface of Docker?**
   - Non-root users, read-only rootfs, minimal images, secret handling, registry trust, and SBOM — from OS hardening to supply-chain hygiene.

11. **What is docker diff and debugging a container?**
   - docker exec -it container sh (inspect), docker logs (stdout), and docker top/inspect — the diagnosing toolkit when something misbehaves.

12. **Define 04 advanced docker in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 04 advanced docker is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 04 advanced docker important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 04 advanced docker?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 04 advanced docker with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 04 advanced docker knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 04 advanced docker?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 04 advanced docker?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 04 advanced docker as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 04 advanced docker interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 04 advanced docker is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 04 advanced docker in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

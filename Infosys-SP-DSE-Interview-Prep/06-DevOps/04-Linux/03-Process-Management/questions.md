# Linux — Process Management Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is a process in Linux?
**A:** A running program instance with PID, state, and address space — listing ps aux shows every one; the OS-process concepts applied.

## Q2: What is the difference between ps and top?
**A:** ps is a static snapshot; top/htop is live, updating CPU/memory per process — diagnose-at-a-moment vs observe-over-time.

## Q3: What is a daemon?
**A:** A background process detached from terminals, started at boot (systemd units) — persistent services like web servers and DBs.

## Q4: How do you manage processes (kill)?
**A:** kill PID sends a signal (SIGTERM graceful, SIGKILL force, SIGSTOP pause); pkill / killall match by name — the terminate vocabulary.

## Q5: What is the difference between foreground and background jobs?
**A:** Foreground occupies the terminal; background (cmd &) returns it; jobs/fg/bg manage them — the job-control model.

## Q6: What is a process tree and parent/child?
**A:** Every process has a parent (PPID); init/systemd (PID 1) reaps orphans — the process hierarchy mirrors the OS concepts.

## Q7: What does the state column in ps show?
**A:** R running, S sleeping, Z zombie, D uninterruptible, T stopped — diagnosing stuck or leaked processes.

## Q8: What is nohup and why use it?
**A:** nohup cmd & detaches the process from the terminal so it survives logout — running long tasks on servers without sessions.

## Q9: How do you find and kill a port-bound process?
**A:** ss -tlnp or lsof -i:8000 to find the PID, then kill — the 'port already in use' remediation for devs.

## Q10: What is a trap in a script?
**A:** trap 'handler' SIGINT/SIGTERM executes cleanup on signals — graceful shutdown handling instead of ugly interruption.

## Q11: What is systemctl and the systemd lifecycle?
**A:** systemctl start/stop/restart/status and enable persist across boots — the modern service orchestrator (vs System V init).

## Q12: Define 03 process management in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 03 process management is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q13: Why is 03 process management important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q14: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 03 process management?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q15: Compare 03 process management with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q16: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 03 process management knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q17: What common misconceptions exist about 03 process management?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q18: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 03 process management?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q19: Describe 03 process management as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q20: How does 03 process management interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q21: What would you change about how 03 process management is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

## Q22: Define 03 process management in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.

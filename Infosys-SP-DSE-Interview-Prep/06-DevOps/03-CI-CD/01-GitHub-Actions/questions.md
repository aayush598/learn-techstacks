1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
   - GitHub's CI/CD platform running jobs from YAML workflows in .github/workflows — triggers on push/PR, on a schedule, or manually.

2. **What is a workflow vs a job vs a step?**
   - Workflow: the YAML file. Jobs: parallel stages on runners. Steps: sequential commands within a job — the three-level hierarchy.

3. **What are events and how do you trigger workflows?**
   - push, pull_request, schedule (cron), workflow_dispatch (manual), and paths/branches filters — trigger precision avoids CI noise.

4. **What is a matrix build?**
   - Testing across OS/python-version combinations (matrix: {'os': [...], 'python': [...]}) — parallel coverage of versions.

5. **What are actions and where do they come from?**
   - Reusable composites (checkout, setup-python) from the Marketplace; you can also inline run: steps or publish your own action.

6. **How do you pass secrets and environment to jobs?**
   - secrets.X from repo/org settings (never printed), env: per-job variables, and concurrency to cancel stale runs — secret hygiene is the core skill.

7. **What is a cache in Actions?**
   - actions/cache persists pip/uv caches between runs — cutting install time from minutes to seconds; the speed win every pipeline needs.

8. **How do you run tests and lint in CI?**
   - steps: install deps -> run pytest -> upload coverage — any red job fails the build; quality gates wired into the merge path.

9. **How do you build and push an image in CI?**
   - docker/login-action + build-push-action with tags derived from the ref and version — the containerised release path.

10. **What is a workflow_dispatch vs scheduled trigger?**
   - manual vs cron — the two 'not every push' flavours you'll add for deploys and nightly jobs.

11. **How do you deploy from Actions?**
   - After tests pass: SSH/cloud-deploy action or kubectl/helm — the CD half of CI/CD, with environment protection rules on main.

12. **Define 01 github actions in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 01 github actions is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 01 github actions important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 01 github actions?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 01 github actions with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 01 github actions knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 01 github actions?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 01 github actions?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 01 github actions as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 01 github actions interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 01 github actions is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 01 github actions in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**
   - One line: 01 github actions is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

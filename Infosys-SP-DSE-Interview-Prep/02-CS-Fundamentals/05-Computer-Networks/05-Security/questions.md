1. **What are the CIA triad properties?**
   - Confidentiality (no unauth access), Integrity (no unauth modification), Availability (stays up) — the foundational security objectives every design must weigh.

2. **What are the common types of attacks?**
   - DDoS, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, MITM, phishing, brute force, and social engineering — know the mechanism and the mitigation for each.

3. **What is a firewall and its types?**
   - A device filtering traffic by rules; packet-filter (layer 3/4) and stateful (tracks connections). Next-gen adds app-layer inspection.

4. **How do you protect an API?**
   - Authentication (OAuth2/JWT), rate limiting, input validation, least-privilege scopes, TLS, CORS lockdown, and logging/monitoring — the exact controls you built into FastAPI.

5. **What is symmetric vs asymmetric encryption?**
   - Symmetric: one shared key (AES) — fast. Asymmetric: key pairs (RSA/ECC), slower — used for key exchange/digital signatures; TLS uses both in a hybrid.

6. **What is a hash vs encryption?**
   - Hash: one-way, fixed-length, deterministic (SHA-256) for integrity/storing passwords. Encryption: reversible with a key for confidentiality. They are not interchangeable.

7. **What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and its mitigation?**
   - Attacker impersonates both ends, intercepting/modifying messages. Mitigations: TLS with certificate validation, pinned certs, mutual TLS.

8. **What is SQL injection and how do you prevent it?**
   - Attacker injects SQL via input to manipulate queries. Prevention: parameterised queries/bind placeholders, ORMs, input validation, least-privilege DB users.

9. **What is XSS and its types?**
   - Injecting client-side scripts to steal data; stored/persistent, reflected, DOM-based. Prevention: escaping output, CSP headers, sanitising input.

10. **What is a CSRF attack and its mitigation?**
   - Forcing a logged-in user to perform unintended requests; mitigation: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, double-submit cookies.

11. **What is a DDoS attack?**
   - Overwhelming a service with traffic (volumetric/application-layer) to make it unavailable (breaks availability). Mitigation: load balancing, rate limiting, CDN/WAF, mitigation services.

12. **What is defence in depth?**
   - Layering independent controls (network, app, data, monitoring) so failure of one doesn't expose the system — the overall security architecture principle.

13. **Define 05 security in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 05 security is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

14. **Why is 05 security important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

15. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 05 security?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

16. **Compare 05 security with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

17. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 05 security knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

18. **What common misconceptions exist about 05 security?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

19. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 05 security?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

20. **Describe 05 security as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

21. **How does 05 security interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

22. **What would you change about how 05 security is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

23. **Define 05 security in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

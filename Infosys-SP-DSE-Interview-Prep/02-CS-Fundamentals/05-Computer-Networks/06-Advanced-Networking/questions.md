# Computer Networks — Advanced Networking Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is load balancing and its algorithms?
**A:** Distributing traffic across servers: round-robin, least-connections, weighted, IP-hash, consistent hashing — each with trade-offs for state locality.

## Q2: What is a reverse proxy vs forward proxy?
**A:** Forward proxy: client-side intermediary. Reverse proxy: server-side front (nginx) hiding backends, adding TLS termination, caching, and routing.

## Q3: What is a CDN?
**A:** A content delivery network caching copies of static content at edge PoPs near users — cutting latency and origin load; the key to fast global sites.

## Q4: What is WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events?
**A:** WebSockets: full-duplex persistent channel (both directions). SSE: one-way server→client over HTTP stream — simpler, auto-reconnect; choose per channel use-case.

## Q5: What is mTLS?
**A:** Mutual TLS authenticates BOTH client and server via certificates — the zero-trust mode for service-to-service security in microservices.

## Q6: What is HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1?
**A:** HTTP/2 multiplexes streams over one connection (head-of-line mitigated at stream level), header compression (HPACK), server-push; HTTP/1.1 opens many connections and serialises responses.

## Q7: What is QUIC / HTTP/3?
**A:** UDP-based transport integrating TLS 1.3 and connection migration — reducing handshake latency (0-RTT) and improving loss recovery (HTTP/3 over QUIC).

## Q8: What is a message queue's role in a distributed network?
**A:** Decoupling producers/consumers asynchronously (Kafka/RabbitMQ) — absorbing bursts, enabling retries, and isolating failure domains between services.

## Q9: What is the role of an API gateway?
**A:** A single entry point aggregating routing, auth, rate limiting, logging, and aggregation for microservices — central policy enforcement.

## Q10: How do you design for network reliability?
**A:** Redundancy (multi-AZ, multiple routes), health checks, retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and load shedding — the SRE-flavoured answer.

## Q11: Define 06 advanced networking in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 06 advanced networking is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q12: Why is 06 advanced networking important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q13: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 06 advanced networking?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q14: Compare 06 advanced networking with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q15: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 06 advanced networking knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q16: What common misconceptions exist about 06 advanced networking?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q17: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 06 advanced networking?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q18: Describe 06 advanced networking as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q19: How does 06 advanced networking interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q20: What would you change about how 06 advanced networking is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

## Q21: Define 06 advanced networking in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.

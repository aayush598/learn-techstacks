1. **What is a scheduler and what metrics matter?**
   - The OS component choosing which ready process runs next; metrics: throughput, latency, turnaround time, waiting time, response time, fairness, and CPU utilisation.

2. **Explain FCFS (First-Come First-Served).**
   - Processes run in arrival order (non-preemptive). Simple, fair-ish, but convoy effect — a long process delays everything behind it, hurting response times.

3. **Explain SJF (Shortest Job First) / SRTF.**
   - Runs the shortest remaining job: SJF non-preemptive, SRTF preemptive. Minimises average waiting time but needs job lengths (unrealistic) and starves long jobs.

4. **Explain Round Robin.**
   - Each process gets a time quantum; a FIFO queue cycles — fair, responsive, great for time-sharing. Quantum too small → context-switch overhead; too big → FCFS-like.

5. **Explain priority scheduling.**
   - Runs the highest-priority process; low-priority can starve (ageing fixes it). Preemptive or not; the classic real-time/priority discussion.

6. **Explain Multilevel Queue / Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ).**
   - Multiple queues with priorities; processes move between queues based on CPU bursts (aging). MLFQ balances responsiveness (interactive) vs throughput (batch) — Linux's CFS sibling.

7. **What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?**
   - Preemptive can interrupt CPU-bound tasks (time-slice based), improving responsiveness; non-preemptive waits for voluntary yield or block — simpler but slower reaction.

8. **What is the convoy effect?**
   - FCFS where one long CPU-bound process holds the CPU, so many short interactive jobs wait behind it; increases average wait and hurts responsiveness.

9. **What is turnaround vs waiting vs response time?**
   - Turnaround = completion - arrival. Waiting = total time in ready queues. Response = first CPU grant - arrival — the three timing metrics for scheduling questions.

10. **Which scheduling does Linux use in practice?**
   - CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler): a red-black tree of vruntime, aims at proportional fairness; newer kernels use EEVDF. State CFS's fairness concept in interviews.

11. **Define 05 scheduling algorithms in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 05 scheduling algorithms is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 05 scheduling algorithms important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 05 scheduling algorithms?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 05 scheduling algorithms with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 05 scheduling algorithms knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 05 scheduling algorithms?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 05 scheduling algorithms?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 05 scheduling algorithms as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 05 scheduling algorithms interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 05 scheduling algorithms is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 05 scheduling algorithms in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

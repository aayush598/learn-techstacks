# Oop — Inheritance Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is inheritance and why use it?
**A:** Creating a new class that reuses and extends an existing class's attributes/methods, promoting code reuse and establishing an is-a relationship.

## Q2: Explain single vs multiple inheritance.
**A:** Single: one base class. Multiple: a class inherits from several bases, merging attribute/method resolution (MRO). Python supports both; Java/C# support only single (plus interfaces).

## Q3: What is method overriding?
**A:** A subclass redefines a base-class method with the same signature, changing behaviour; the call dispatches to the subclass version at runtime (polymorphism in action).

## Q4: What is method overloading and does Python have it?
**A:** Multiple methods with the same name but different signatures. Python doesn't support compile-time overloading; use default arguments or *args/**kwargs to emulate it.

## Q5: What is super() in Python?
**A:** super() returns a proxy that delegates calls up the MRO, letting a subclass call the parent's version of a method — essential for cooperative multiple inheritance.

## Q6: What is the MRO (Method Resolution Order)?
**A:** The order in which Python searches base classes for an attribute/method, computed by C3 linearisation. Check via ClassName.__mro__.

## Q7: What is the diamond problem?
**A:** In multiple inheritance, when two bases share a common ancestor, the ancestor's method could be called twice; Python's C3 MRO resolves it so the shared ancestor runs once, in priotised order.

## Q8: What is an abstract class?
**A:** A class that may have abstract methods (declared but not implemented) and cannot be instantiated directly; subclasses must implement abstract methods (abc module).

## Q9: What is the difference between extends (is-a) and contains (has-a)?
**A:** Inheritance models is-a; composition models has-a (an instance held as an attribute). Composition is preferred for flexibility (favour composition over inheritance).

## Q10: When should you NOT use inheritance?
**A:** When the relationship is has-a rather than is-a, when only one method needs reuse, or when deep hierarchies make the code rigid — prefer composition or interface-based design.

## Q11: What is a mixin?
**A:** A class providing reusable behaviour meant to be combined via multiple inheritance, not instantiated alone (e.g., to provide extra methods to various unrelated classes).

## Q12: What is `object` in Python?
**A:** The root of the class hierarchy — every class implicitly inherits from object, providing __str__, __repr__, __eq__, __hash__ defaults.

## Q13: What is method resolution in a subclass that doesn't override?
**A:** The attribute lookup walks the MRO and uses the first match; so unoverridden methods are inherited from the nearest ancestor that defines them.

## Q14: How do you verify type relationships (issubclass, isinstance)?
**A:** issubclass(Derived, Base) and isinstance(obj, Base) check inheritance relationships — isinstance returns True for any class in the MRO.

## Q15: Define 02 inheritance in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 02 inheritance is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q16: Why is 02 inheritance important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q17: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 02 inheritance?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q18: Compare 02 inheritance with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q19: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 02 inheritance knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q20: What common misconceptions exist about 02 inheritance?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q21: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 02 inheritance?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q22: Describe 02 inheritance as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q23: How does 02 inheritance interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q24: What would you change about how 02 inheritance is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

# Oop — Real World Oop Problems Interview Questions and Answers

## Q1: Model a Bank Account in OOP.
**A:** Class Account with balance encapsulated, deposit/withdraw validating state (encapsulation), subclasses Savings/Current overriding interest logic (inheritance + polymorphism), methods as the only state change path.

## Q2: Design a Vehicle hierarchy.
**A:** Vehicle base with start()/stop(), Car/Bike/Truck subclasses override behaviour; an interface Drivable could decouple callers — showing is-a via inheritance and polymorphic use.

## Q3: Design a notification system (email/SMS/push).
**A:** NotificationSender interface; EmailSender/SmsSender/PushSender implement send(); a NotificationService depends on the interface (DIP) — the classic OOP system design.

## Q4: Model an e-commerce cart with discounts.
**A:** Cart (composition of items), Strategy discount strategies (percentage/flat/coupon), price computed polymorphically — cleanly demonstrates composition + strategy.

## Q5: Design a library management system.
**A:** Loan, Member, Book classes; Repository for persistence, Service for business rules, Controller/CLI for interaction — layering maps to real FastAPI service structure.

## Q6: What are the common OOP code smells in these problems?
**A:** God classes (bloated responsibilities), deep inheritance, leaked invariants (exposed state), and duplicated logic — fixing these with SOLID restores clean design.

## Q7: Design an AI-agent pipeline with OOP.
**A:** Agent base with run(); Tool interface; RAGRetriever, LLMHandler as components injected into the agent — matches your Agno/LangChain-styled code.

## Q8: Model a chess game.
**A:** Piece abstract with canMove()/value(); each piece class overrides; Board manages squares; Move validation dispatches polymorphically — a favourite OOP design exercise.

## Q9: Design a hotel booking system with overlapping bookings.
**A:** Room entity, Booking with check-in/out, overlap detection via interval logic, validation in setters — encapsulation + service-layer validation.

## Q10: Design a payment processing system supporting multiple gateways.
**A:** PaymentGateway interface, RazorpayGateway/StripeGateway adapters, PaymentService using the interface — Adapter + Strategy + DIP combined.

## Q11: Define 09 real world oop problems in one line and then expand with a real-world example.
**A:** One line: 09 real world oop problems is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

## Q12: Why is 09 real world oop problems important in real production systems?
**A:** It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

## Q13: What are the advantages and disadvantages of 09 real world oop problems?
**A:** Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

## Q14: Compare 09 real world oop problems with alternatives and state when to prefer which.
**A:** Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

## Q15: Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 09 real world oop problems knowledge applied.
**A:** In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

## Q16: What common misconceptions exist about 09 real world oop problems?
**A:** People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

## Q17: How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 09 real world oop problems?
**A:** Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

## Q18: Describe 09 real world oop problems as if explaining to a new hire.
**A:** Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

## Q19: How does 09 real world oop problems interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?
**A:** Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

## Q20: What would you change about how 09 real world oop problems is taught, based on your experience?
**A:** Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

## Q21: Define 09 real world oop problems in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.

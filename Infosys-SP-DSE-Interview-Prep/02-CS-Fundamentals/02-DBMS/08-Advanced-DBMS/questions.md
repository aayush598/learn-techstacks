1. **What is a materialized view?**
   - A view whose result set is physically stored and refreshed (manually/scheduled) — precomputed aggregates for fast reads at the cost of staleness.

2. **What is query optimisation and what does a query planner do?**
   - Planner estimates costs of plans (index/full scan, join order, hash vs nested loop) and picks an execution plan; stats quality and indexes steer it. EXPLAIN shows the chosen plan.

3. **What are join algorithms?**
   - Nested loop (small/inner), hash join (equi-join on moderate tables), merge join (sorted inputs) — the DB picks based on stats; knowing them helps you write joinable queries.

4. **What is partition pruning?**
   - The planner skipping partitions that can't contain matching rows (via WHERE on the partition key) — crucial for huge time-series tables.

5. **What is a JSONB column and when would you use it?**
   - PostgreSQL's binary JSON — flexible nested data with GIN indexing; use for naturally flexible/occasionally-queried shapes instead of over-splitting schema.

6. **What is a database paradigm 'ACID vs BASE'?**
   - ACID = strict consistency; BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) = NoSQL's relaxed model for scale — the trade-off spectrum in distributed stores.

7. **What is replication and its types?**
   - Copying data to replica DBs: synchronous (strong) vs asynchronous (eventual lag), streaming replication for read scaling and failover.

8. **What is a deadlock's resolution strategy?**
   - Consistent lock ordering, timeouts (lock_timeout / innodb_lock_wait_timeout), and DB-level deadlock detection aborting one victim with retry.

9. **What is a database connection vs a connection pool size tuning?**
   - Opening a connection is expensive (auth, memory); a pool resizes per workload. Oversized pools waste memory; undersized pools throttle — monitor active/inactive.

10. **How do you handle time zones in a DB?**
   - Store TIMESTAMPTZ (UTC), convert on display; never store local time in a TIMESTAMP column — the classic silent-bug.

11. **Define 08 advanced dbms in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 08 advanced dbms is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 08 advanced dbms important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 08 advanced dbms?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 08 advanced dbms with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 08 advanced dbms knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 08 advanced dbms?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 08 advanced dbms?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 08 advanced dbms as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 08 advanced dbms interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 08 advanced dbms is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 08 advanced dbms in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

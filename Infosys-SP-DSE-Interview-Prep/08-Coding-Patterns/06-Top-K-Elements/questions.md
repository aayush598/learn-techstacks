1. **What is the top-k pattern?**
   - Finding the k largest/smallest/most-frequent elements efficiently — heap-based O(n log k) selection that beats full sorting when k is small.

2. **What is the min-heap approach for top-k largest?**
   - Maintain a min-heap of size k; for each element, push it and pop the smallest when size exceeds k — the heap always holds the current top-k, O(n log k) total.

3. **When would you sort instead of heap?**
   - When k is comparable to n (sorting is O(n log n) same order) or you need the full order; heap wins decisively when k << n (e.g., top-10 of 1M).

4. **How do you find top-k frequent using a Counter plus heap?**
   - Build counts via Counter (O(n)), then push (count, element) into a min-heap keeping size k — O(n log k); compare with bucket sort for O(n) when k ~ categories.

5. **What is the quickselect alternative?**
   - Hoare-partition selection on the array of scores, discarding the half that can't contain the answer — O(n) average time, O(1) space but not stable.

6. **What is the priority queue key ordering convention?**
   - Python heapq is a min-heap on tuples lexicographically — (count, item) keeps lowest count on top as desired, or use negative keys for max behaviour.

7. **What is the difference between this and the heap-pattern?**
   - The top-k pattern IS the heap pattern applied to selection; the heap pattern additionally covers merge-k-sorted and sliding-window-maximum style applications.

8. **How do you return the k closest points to origin?**
   - Push (squared-distance, point) into a max-heap of size k and evict the farthest — equivalently a min-heap with negatives; O(n log k).

9. **What is the time/space profile?**
   - O(n log k) time, O(k) space for heap approaches — vs O(n log n)/O(n) for sort; giving both and justifying the choice is the expected interview behaviour.

10. **What edge cases need handling?**
   - k == 0, k >= n (return everything sorted), duplicates and ties in frequency, and negative values (they sort normally but ordered-heap keys need consistent polarity).

11. **Define 06 top k elements in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 06 top k elements is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 06 top k elements important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 06 top k elements?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 06 top k elements with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 06 top k elements knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 06 top k elements?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 06 top k elements?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 06 top k elements as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 06 top k elements interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 06 top k elements is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 06 top k elements in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

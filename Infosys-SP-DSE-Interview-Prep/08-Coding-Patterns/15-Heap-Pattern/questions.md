1. **What is a heap?**
   - A complete binary tree stored in an array where each node dominates its children (min-heap: parent <= children) — O(log n) push/pop, O(1) peek of the extreme.

2. **How is a heap implemented in Python?**
   - heapq: a list with heappush/heappop — min-heap by default; max-behaviour by negating keys; heapify converts a list to a heap in O(n).

3. **What is `heap` vs `priority queue`?**
   - A priority queue IS the abstract interface (insert + extract-min/max); a binary heap is its classic array-based implementation — they're often used interchangeably.

4. **What are the heap's core operations and complexities?**
   - peek O(1), push/pop O(log n), heapify O(n), decrease-key O(log n) — the four numbers every heap answer starts with.

5. **When is a heap the right choice?**
   - Repeatedly extracting the extreme or merging streams (top-k, merge-k-sorted, running median, Dijkstra/Kruskal) — any 'always need the current worst/best' workload.

6. **What is the running-median problem?**
   - Two heaps (max-heap of lower half, min-heap of upper half) rebalanced on each insert — O(log n) per insert and O(1) median retrieval.

7. **What is the difference between a heap and a sorted array?**
   - A sorted array has O(1) exact extremes but O(n) insert; a heap gives O(log n) both — pick by whether insert frequency dominates.

8. **What is a heap-based k-way merge vs iterative min scanning?**
   - A heap of k heads gives O(n log k) vs O(nk) scanning all k lists each step — the same selection as the k-way-merge pattern.

9. **How does a heap implement Dijkstra's frontier?**
   - A min-heap over (distance, node) with lazy deletions pops the nearest unvisited node each step — the classic shortest-path priority queue.

10. **What is 'decrease-key' and when do you need it?**
   - In Dijkstra/A*, reducing a node's key after a better path is found; Python heapq lacks decrease-key — workaround: push a duplicate entry and skip stale pops by confirming the distance.

11. **What are the edge cases?**
   - Empty heap (guard pops/peeks), duplicate priorities (add a counter tiebreaker), interleaved operations, and large dashes of pushes/pops (verify heap invariants via inspection).

12. **What is heapify's O(n) magic?**
   - Building from the bottom up costs a sum over subtree heights — mostly O(1) per node, O(n) total — versus O(n log n) for n consecutive pushes.

13. **Define 15 heap pattern in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 15 heap pattern is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

14. **Why is 15 heap pattern important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

15. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 15 heap pattern?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

16. **Compare 15 heap pattern with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

17. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 15 heap pattern knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

18. **What common misconceptions exist about 15 heap pattern?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

19. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 15 heap pattern?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

20. **Describe 15 heap pattern as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

21. **How does 15 heap pattern interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

22. **What would you change about how 15 heap pattern is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

23. **Define 15 heap pattern in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

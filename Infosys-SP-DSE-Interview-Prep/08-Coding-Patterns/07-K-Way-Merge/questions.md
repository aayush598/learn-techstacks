1. **What is the k-way merge pattern?**
   - Merging k sorted lists/arrays in O(n log k) using a heap of k heads — extending the standard two-way merge to arbitrary k inputs.

2. **What is the algorithm?**
   - Push each list's head (value,list_index) into a min-heap; repeatedly pop the min, add it to output, and push that list's next element — O(n log k).

3. **What is the complexity and why?**
   - Each output element costs O(log k) for one push/pop; with n total elements it's O(n log k) time and O(k) heap space — versus O(nk) naive scanning.

4. **When does k-way merge beat flatten-and-sort?**
   - When inputs are already sorted (very often in interview problems): merge is O(n log k), sort is O(n log n) — win when k << n and inputs are ready.

5. **How do ties and duplicate values across lists get handled?**
   - Heap tuples compare lexicographically — include the list index in the tuple so equal values from different lists both emerge in stable order.

6. **What is merge-k-sorted-lists's classic solution?**
   - A min-heap holding one node per list; pop-min appends to result, then push that list's next node — the canonical LeetCode 23 solution, O(n log k).

7. **How does this connect to external merge sort?**
   - In disk sorting you merge many sorted runs with an external k-way merge — the same heap frontier, bounded by run buffers instead of RAM.

8. **What is the two-way merge relationship?**
   - k=2 reduces to the classic merge step of merge sort — the pattern generalises it; combining batched merges (divide-and-conquer pairwise) gives the same O(n log k).

9. **What are the edge cases?**
   - Empty lists among the k inputs, a single non-empty list, k == 0, and lists of drastically different lengths — skip empties upfront.

10. **When would you NOT use a heap?**
   - When k is small and lists are tiny — a flattened sort (O(n log n)) or pairwise merges may be simpler and faster in constants; state the trade-off.

11. **Define 07 k way merge in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 07 k way merge is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

12. **Why is 07 k way merge important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

13. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 07 k way merge?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

14. **Compare 07 k way merge with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

15. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 07 k way merge knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

16. **What common misconceptions exist about 07 k way merge?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

17. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 07 k way merge?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

18. **Describe 07 k way merge as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

19. **How does 07 k way merge interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

20. **What would you change about how 07 k way merge is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

21. **Define 07 k way merge in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**

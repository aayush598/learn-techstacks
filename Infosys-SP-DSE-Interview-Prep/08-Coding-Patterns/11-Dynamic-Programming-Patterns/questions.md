1. **What is the dynamic programming pattern?**
   - Solving problems by combining solutions to overlapping subproblems, storing them in a table — beating exponential recursion by avoiding recomputation.

2. **What are the two implementation styles?**
   - Top-down (memoised recursion: recursive call + cache) and bottom-up (iteration filling a table in dependency order) — equivalent results; pick by clarity and recursion limits.

3. **How do you recognise a DP problem?**
   - Optimal substructure (the best solution uses best solutions of subproblems) + overlapping subproblems (same subproblem solved repeatedly) — the two required properties.

4. **What is the standard DP framework?**
   - 1) Define state (what am I computing?), 2) recurrence/transition (how to express state in smaller states), 3) base cases, 4) answer location, 5) complexity — in that order.

5. **What is the difference between DP and greedy?**
   - Greedy makes a locally optimal choice once with no backtracking; DP evaluates all choices via subproblem optimums — valid only when greedy's simple rule provably works.

6. **What are the classic 1-DP patterns?**
   - Climbing stairs, house robber (take/skip with state), longest increasing subarray — single-array transitions ending 'at i' — the entry point to recurrence design.

7. **What is the knapsack (0/1) pattern?**
   - State dp[i][w] = best using first i items within capacity w; transition take/skip; the template for subset-sum, partition, and coin-change constrained variants.

8. **What is the 2D-grid DP pattern?**
   - dp[i][j] from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] (paths) or dp[i-1][j-1] (edit distance) — the matrix-problem template with row-major bottom-up filling.

9. **What is the state-machine DP pattern?**
   - Maintain a few states per step (hold/sold/cool) transitioning between them — multi-state 1-DP that handles buy-sell-stock and sequential-decision problems.

10. **What is the time/space trade-off in DP?**
   - Full tables are O(states) space; many transitions only need the previous row — rolling arrays cut space to O(1) or O(n) while keeping time equal.

11. **When does DP fail?**
   - When subproblems aren't overlapping (divide-and-conquer instead) or the optimal substructure doesn't hold — e.g., longest simple path — and when state space explodes (your choice vs greedy/backtracking).

12. **Define 11 dynamic programming patterns in one line and then expand with a real-world example.**
   - One line: 11 dynamic programming patterns is a core concept/mechanism in computer science governing how systems organise and process data. Real-world example: it maps to daily objects (library shelves, queues at a counter) so the abstract idea has an intuitive concrete anchor the interviewer can build on.

13. **Why is 11 dynamic programming patterns important in real production systems?**
   - It directly affects correctness, performance, resource usage and maintainability. Understanding it lets an engineer reason about trade-offs, anticipate failure modes, and choose the right tool, which is exactly the engineering judgement a Specialist Digital Engineer role needs.

14. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of 11 dynamic programming patterns?**
   - Advantages: predictability of behaviour, standardised semantics, widely understood patterns. Disadvantages: each design brings overhead or constraints, so it must be balanced against simplicity and project context whenever an alternative exists.

15. **Compare 11 dynamic programming patterns with alternatives and state when to prefer which.**
   - Compare by criteria: speed, memory, complexity, latency, consistency. There is no universal best — the winner depends on the workload (read-heavy vs write-heavy, scale, consistency requirements); state the decision matrix explicitly.

16. **Give a scenario from your own projects (FastAPI services, RAG pipelines, COTS automation) where 11 dynamic programming patterns knowledge applied.**
   - In building backend services and AI pipelines, concepts like this guided API design, data flow and error handling; referencing one concrete project decision makes the answer credible and ties theory to your resume.

17. **What common misconceptions exist about 11 dynamic programming patterns?**
   - People confuse terminologies that sound similar, assume a feature is 'automatic' when it needs configuration, or copy-paste patterns without understanding trade-offs. Clearing each misconception shows depth beyond definitions.

18. **How would you test correctness of a system that relies on 11 dynamic programming patterns?**
   - Unit tests for the isolated logic, integration tests for the interplay with other components, plus failure/scenario tests (edge inputs, stress). This matches your pytest/unittest experience with CI pipelines.

19. **Describe 11 dynamic programming patterns as if explaining to a new hire.**
   - Start from the goal it serves, add a minimal concrete analogy, state its constraints, then show the simplest possible example — the learning order matters more than dumping terminology.

20. **How does 11 dynamic programming patterns interact with performance (time/space trade-off)?**
   - Typically it trades one resource for another (space for speed, or latency for consistency). Quantify with complexity wherever possible and mention measurable impact on the user-facing system.

21. **What would you change about how 11 dynamic programming patterns is taught, based on your experience?**
   - Move from memorisation of syntax/terms to practice with small concrete problems, because understanding only solidifies through application — this mirrors how you structured your own learning for placement interviews.

22. **Define 11 dynamic programming patterns in one line and then expand with a real-world example. Extend your answer with a second example.**
